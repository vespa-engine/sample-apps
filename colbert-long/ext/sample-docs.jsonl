In-programme advertising is allowed, but counted toward the 12-minute quota, means that if a 60-minute show has 2 minutes of in-programme advertising, the commercial breaks have to be limited to 10 minutes for that specific hour, otherwise the station might face a fine. Promos for future television programs are considered as an advertisement, and also counted within the quota. Argentine television channels used to be required to separate advertising from the rest of the programming using bumpers with the text \"Espacio publicitario\" (\"Advertising space\") from September 2010 to May 2016.From March 2014, advertisements shown on Argentine television began to use the phrase \"Aviso publicitario de producci\u00f3n nacional\" (Advertisement for domestic product) and \"Aviso publicitario de producci\u00f3n extranjera\" (Advertisement for foreign product) for local and foreign advertisements, respectively. Also, advertisements for alcoholic products had the warning \"Beber con moderaci\u00f3n. Prohibida su venta a menores de 18 a\u00f1os\" (Drink in moderation. Sales to persons under 18 prohibited). The warning was not used in alcohol advertising before 1997.United States", "In the United States, the Nielsen ratings system measures audience viewership of television programs, and provides a way for television broadcasters to determine how popular their television shows are, so that they can decide what rates to charge advertisers for air time.For each hour in a broadcast day, advertisements take up a fairly large portion of the time. Commercial breaks have become longer over the decades. In the 1960s a typical hour-long American show would run for 51 minutes excluding advertisements. Today, a similar program would only be 42 minutes long; a typical 30-minute block of time now includes 22 minutes of programming and eight minutes of advertisements \u2013 six minutes for national advertising and two minutes for local.A television broadcast of the 101-minute film The Wizard of Oz (1939) for instance, could, in the early to mid-1960s, take two hours even with advertisements. Today, a telecast of the same film would last between 2\u00bd and three hours, including advertisements. Because of this, it is common practice to edit films to fit within the time allotted.Over the course of 10 hours, American viewers will be shown approximately three hours of advertisements, twice what they would have seen in the 1960s. If a 1960s show is rerun today, the content may be edited by nine minutes to make room for the extra advertisements.", "In the 1950s and 1960s, the average advertisement's length was one minute. Starting in the early 1970s, the average length shrank to 30 seconds. The 15-second commercial began to appear in the late 1980s.TV advertisements were coded for identification by broadcasters via an ISCI code. As of March 31, 2014, Ad-ID has been mandated as the standard method of identification for TV advertisements.A special case of TV advertisements are rare or one-time events known as mega event advertising.PopularityIn the United States, the TV advertisement is generally considered the most effective mass-market advertising format, and this is reflected by the high prices TV networks charge for commercial broadcasting airtime during popular TV events. The annual Super Bowl football game is known as much for its commercial advertisements as for the game itself, and the average cost of a single 30-second TV spot during this game (seen by 100 million viewers) has reached US$4.5\u00a0million (as of February 2013).It has been suggested that, in general, television executives believe that advertisers covet the 18\u201349 age demographic and that older viewers are of almost no interest to most advertisers due to their unwillingness to change their buying habits. Products intended for older consumers, such as certain health products and insurance, are advertised regularly on television, generally during programming that appeals to older adults.", "The number of viewers within the target demographic is more important to ad revenues than total viewers.  According to Advertising Age, during the 2007\u201308 season, Grey's Anatomy was able to charge $419,000 per advertisement, compared to only $248,000 for an advertisement during CSI, despite CSI having almost five million more viewers on average. Due to its demographic strength, Friends was able to charge almost three times as much for an advertisement as Murder, She Wrote, even though the two series had similar total viewer numbers during the seasons they were on the air together. Broadcast networks are concerned by the increasing use of DVRs by younger viewers, resulting in aging of the live viewing audience and consequently, lower advertising rates. TV advertisers may also target certain audiences of the population such as certain races, and people of a certain income level or gender. In recent years, shows that tend to target young women tend to be more profitable for advertisements than shows targeted to younger men. This is due to the fact that younger men are watching TV less than their female counterparts.", "In the United Kingdom, television advertising is considerably cheaper than in the United States. The current record for an advertising slot on British terrestrial television is quoted at being \u00a3250,000 for a 30-second slot during the 2010 series of Britain's Got Talent. However while British TV advertising is cheaper, this is only to be expected as the United Kingdom has a much lower population (63\u00a0million) compared to the U.S. (310\u00a0million). So if the \u00a3250,000 figure is adjusted into U.S. terms, the population being 5 times bigger and the exchange rate, this figure would become $2\u00a0million, much closer to the U.S. Super Bowl figure.", "Because a single television advertisement can be broadcast repeatedly over the course of weeks, months, and even years (the Tootsie Roll company has been broadcasting a well-known animated advertisement that asks \"How many licks does it take to get to the tootsie center of a Tootsie Pop?\" for over three decades), television advertisement production studios often spend very large amounts of money in the production of a single 30-second television spot. This significant expenditure has resulted in a number of high-quality advertisements with high production values, the latest in special effects technology, the most popular personalities, and the best music. A number of television advertisements are so elaborately produced that they can be considered short 30-second movies; indeed, many film directors have directed television advertisements both as a way to gain exposure and to earn a paycheck. One of film director Ridley Scott's most famous cinematic moments was a television advertisement he directed for the Apple Macintosh computer, that was broadcast in 1984. Although this advertisement was broadcast only once (aside from occasional appearances in television advertisement compilation specials and one 1 a.m. airing in Idaho a month before the Super Bowl so that the advertisement could be submitted for the 1983 Clio Awards), it has become famous and well-known, to the point where it is considered a classic television moment.", "Despite the popularity of some advertisements, many consider them to be an annoyance for a number of reasons. The main reason may be that the loudness of advertisements tends to be higher (and in some cases much higher) than that of regular programming. The United States Congress passed a bill on September 30, 2010, called the CALM Act, to reduce the sound volume of advertisements, and loudness rules set by the FCC are effective as of December 13, 2012. In the UK, the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice has a similar regulation.  The increasing number of advertisements, as well as overplaying of the same advertisement, are secondary annoyance factors. A third might be that television is currently the main medium to advertise, prompting advertising campaigns by everyone from cell-phone companies, political campaigns, fast food restaurants, to local businesses, and small businesses, prompting longer commercial breaks. Another reason is that advertisements often cut into certain parts in the regular programming that are either climaxes of the plot or a major turning point in the show, which many people find exciting or entertaining to watch.Restrictions", "Beginning on January 2, 1971, advertisements featuring cigarettes were banned from American TV. Advertisements for alcohol products are allowed, but the consumption of any alcohol product is not allowed in a television advertisement (for example, an actor in a beer commercial cannot be shown actually drinking the beer). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have laid out regulations for television advertising, outlining restrictions on certain products, content, and claims, in addition to mandating minimum technical standards. Additional content standards are set by individual television broadcast entities to accommodate local laws, community standards, and their particular audience demographic; these broadcast outlets examine each incoming advertisement through a process known as \"clearance.\"", "Manufacturers of liquor products also adopted a voluntary code not to advertise on radio and television, which is particularly aimed at avoiding exposure of liquor advertisements to children. When companies dropped this ban, federal regulators appealed to the industry to reinstate code while the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was also asked to look into potential restrictions on liquor advertisements on television. This was the case because, under the Communications Act, this agency has the power to regulate broadcasting as \"public convenience, interest, or necessity requires.\" Aside from the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also has the authority to regulate television advertising in instances of \"unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce.\" The passage of the 1990 Children's Television Act (CTA), restricted the length of advertising in children's television programming to 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays.", "Advertisements as programmingSince the 1960s, media critics have claimed that the boundaries between \"programming\" and \"advertisements\" have been eroded to the point where the line is blurred nearly as much as it was during the beginnings of the medium, when almost all individual television shows were sponsored entirely by a single corporation (the model which was carried over from old-time network radio). For much of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the FCC imposed a rule requiring networks that broadcast programming on Saturday morning and Sunday nights at 7\u00a0p.m./6 p.m. Central to air bumpers (\"We'll return after these messages...\", \"...now back to our programming\" and variations thereof) to help younger audiences distinguish programs from advertisements. The only programs that were exempt from this rule were news shows and information shows relating to news (such as 60 Minutes). Conditions on children's programming have relaxed to an extent since the period of the 1970s and 1980s.", "EuropeIn many European countries, television advertisements appear in longer, but less frequent advertising breaks. For example, instead of 3 minutes every 8 minutes, there might be around 6 minutes every half-hour. European Union legislation limits the time taken by commercial breaks to 12 minutes per hour (20%), with a minimum segment length of 20 or 30 minutes, depending on the programme content. Live imported telecasts with shorter segments, such as U.S. sporting events, replace the original ads with promotional material. Advertising broadcast time can vary within the EU and other countries and between networks depending on local policy. Unlike in the United States, in Europe the advertising agency name may appear at the beginning or at the end of the advert.CroatiaIn Croatia, the commercial broadcasters may show up to 12 minutes of advertising per hour, while the public broadcaster HRT, being partially funded by a license fee, shows less advertising and normally does not interrupt series and films. Tobacco advertising is banned but alcohol and non-prescription medications can be advertised on TV. Political advertisements are allowed only in the short official campaign period before an election and only in separate blocks from other advertisements.", "DenmarkThe Danish DR-networks are funded by a television licence, so they do not show any advertisements. The other Danish television network, TV2 shows advertisements only in blocks between the programs. These can take from 2 minutes to 10 minutes depending on the time to the next show. In Denmark, commercial breaks are strictly taboo and advertising targeted to children is restricted. Networks like Kanal 5 and TV3 are allowed to interrupt programs, as these networks are being broadcast via satellite from the United Kingdom.", "FinlandIn Finland, there are two mainstream non-commercial networks run by the state-owned broadcasting company YLE, that run advertisements only on very infrequent occasions, such as important sport events. The three main commercial networks MTV3, Sub (a subsidiary of MTV3), and Nelonen, all run their advertisements during breaks approximately every 15 minutes. Since digital TV has been introduced, the number of TV channels has expand, with YLE and the main broadcasters all adding new channels (including some subscription channels). Analogue broadcasts ceased in August 2007 and the nation's TV services are now exclusively digital. A typical break lasts about 4 minutes. The length of individual advertisements can vary from a few seconds (7, 10, and 15 are common), and they are currently rarely over one minute in length. Most advertisements of supranational companies are commonly dubbed from English language advertisements. Although Swedish is the other official language of Finland, the advertisements do not feature Swedish subtitles nor are any Swedish language advertisements shown with the infrequent exception of some political advertisements at the time of elections.", "FranceThe Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel allows up to 9 minutes of advertising per hour on average in a day, and 12 minutes in an hour. Private networks can only broadcast one commercial break if the show is less than an hour and two commercial breaks if the show is more than an hour. For public networks, advertising is allowed up to 6 minutes per hour on average, and forbidden after 8\u00a0pm.GermanyAs in Britain, in Germany, public television stations own a major share of the market. Their programming is funded by a licence fee as well as advertisements on specific hours of the day (20 minutes per day; not after 8\u00a0pm), except on Sundays and holidays. Private stations are allowed to show up to 12 minutes of advertisements per hour with a minimum of 20 minutes of programming in between interruptions.", "GreeceIn Greece, where most television stations and networks do not remove their logo before a commercial break, it is mandatory for public and commercial TV stations to separate the advertisements from the rest of the program with each station's ident. Subliminal advertising, tobacco and medication advertisements are banned. Most programmes (series, documentaries, etc.) can have one commercial break every 20 minutes. Advertisements must not exceed 15% of the broadcasting day or 20% if there are direct advertisements for buying or renting products (like informercials). A commercial break must not exceed the length of 4 minutes with the exceptions of movies/telefilms with the length exceeding the 45 minutes, which can have one commercial break for 9 minutes and of the movies/telefilms that exceed the length of 110 minutes which can have more than one commercial break every 45 minutes for 9 minutes.IrelandIn Ireland, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland determines the number of adverts on commercial and community TV stations, while the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is responsible for the advertising limits of Public Service Broadcasters on TV and Radio, and commercial radio advertising is governed through statute.", "The first television adverts were shown on December 31, 1961. But in the early years all were in black-and-white but in the 1970s came in colour television arrived. Adverts were very popular over the years. The most popular names being Gateaux Cakes, Tayto Crisps etc.Up to 2010 commercial broadcasters were permitted a maximum of 15% advertising time vs. overall broadcast time. In 2010, TV3 (now Virgin Media TV) asked for an increase in advertising minutes due to the high level of competition from advertising opt-outs coming into Ireland via satellite and cable pay providers, and also the number of live ITV programmes carried by TV3 (such as The X Factor). The BAI agreed to increase the number of ads on commercial TV broadcasts to bring Irish commercial TV channels into line with UK commercial TV channels. The Independent Broadcasters of Ireland also lobbied for a similar increase, but the regulator was unable to increase their advertising minutes as these are written into Statue, meaning that any change is the responsibility of the members of the national parliament (The House of the Oireachtas).Commercial Broadcasters may not exceed 18% of their broadcast day on advertising and they may only have a maximum of 12 minutes of adverts per hour, except for children's programming where advertising may not exceed 10 minutes per hour (commercial TV broadcasters includes Virgin Media TV).

Usually, the publicity intervals had a duration limited from 5 to 10 minutes and hidden publicity was categorically forbidden out of the established TV timetables.The commercial TV, namely the Mediaset group founded by Silvio Berlusconi, imported in Italy a model of propaganda that was diffused by some decades before in North American countries. It consisted of short spots directly focused on attracting the consumer in the shortest possible time. The same modality was suddenly copied by the public television.", "NorwayTelevision advertising is regulated by the Broadcasting Act.

{"put": "id:en:doc::doc-en-1829", "fields": {"id": "doc-en-1829", "text": ["A superheterodyne receiver, often shortened to superhet, is a type of radio receiver that uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed than the original carrier frequency. It was long believed to have been invented by US engineer Edwin Armstrong, but after some controversy the earliest patent for the invention is now credited to French radio engineer and radio manufacturer Lucien L\u00e9vy. Virtually all modern radio receivers use the superheterodyne principle; except those software-defined radios using direct sampling.HistoryHeterodyne Early Morse code radio broadcasts were produced using an alternator connected to a spark gap. The output signal was at a carrier frequency defined by the physical construction of the gap, modulated by the alternating current signal from the alternator. Since the output frequency of the alternator was generally in the audible range, this produces an audible amplitude modulated (AM) signal. Simple radio detectors filtered out the high-frequency carrier, leaving the modulation, which was passed on to the user's headphones as an audible signal of dots and dashes.", "In 1904, Ernst Alexanderson introduced the Alexanderson alternator, a device that directly produced radio frequency output with higher power and much higher efficiency than the older spark gap systems. In contrast to the spark gap, however, the output from the alternator was a pure carrier wave at a selected frequency. When detected on existing receivers, the dots and dashes would normally be inaudible, or \"supersonic\". Due to the filtering effects of the receiver, these signals generally produced a click or thump, which were audible but made determining dot or dash difficult.In 1905, Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden came up with the idea of using two Alexanderson alternators operating at closely spaced frequencies to broadcast two signals, instead of one. The receiver would then receive both signals, and as part of the detection process, only the beat frequency would exit the receiver. By selecting two carriers close enough that the beat frequency was audible, the resulting Morse code could once again be easily heard even in simple receivers. For instance, if the two alternators operated at frequencies 3\u00a0kHz apart, the output in the headphones would be dots or dashes of 3\u00a0kHz tone, making them easily audible.Fessenden coined the term \"heterodyne\", meaning \"generated by a difference\" (in frequency), to describe this system. The word is derived from the Greek roots hetero- \"different\", and -dyne \"power\".", "RegenerationMorse code was widely used in the early days of radio because it was both easy to produce and easy to receive.  In contrast to voice broadcasts, the output of the amplifier didn't have to closely match the modulation of the original signal.  As a result, any number of simple amplification systems could be used. One method used an interesting side-effect of early triode amplifier tubes. If both the plate (anode) and grid were connected to resonant circuits tuned to the same frequency and the stage gain was much higher than unity, stray capacitive coupling between the grid and the plate would cause the amplifier to go into oscillation.In 1913, Edwin Howard Armstrong described a receiver system that used this effect to produce audible Morse code output using a single triode. The output of the amplifier taken at the anode was connected back to the input through a \"tickler\", causing feedback that drove input signals well beyond unity. This caused the output to oscillate at a chosen frequency with great amplification. When the original signal cut off at the end of the dot or dash, the oscillation decayed and the sound disappeared after a short delay.Armstrong referred to this concept as a regenerative receiver, and it immediately became one of the most widely used systems of its era. Many radio systems of the 1920s were based on the regenerative principle, and it continued to be used in specialized roles into the 1940s, for instance in the IFF Mark II.", "RDFThere was one role where the regenerative system was not suitable, even for Morse code sources, and that was the task of radio direction finding, or RDF.The regenerative system was highly non-linear, amplifying any signal above a certain threshold by a huge amount, sometimes so large it caused it to turn into a transmitter (which was the entire concept behind IFF). In RDF, the strength of the signal is used to determine the location of the transmitter, so one requires linear amplification to allow the strength of the original signal, often very weak, to be accurately measured.To address this need, RDF systems of the era used triodes operating below unity. To get a usable signal from such a system, tens or even hundreds of triodes had to be used, connected together anode-to-grid. These amplifiers drew enormous amounts of power and required a team of maintenance engineers to keep them running. Nevertheless, the strategic value of direction finding on weak signals was so high that the British Admiralty felt the high cost was justified.Superheterodyne", "Although a number of researchers discovered the superheterodyne concept, filing patents only months apart (see below), Armstrong is often credited with the concept. He came across it while considering better ways to produce RDF receivers. He had concluded that moving to higher \"short wave\" frequencies would make RDF more useful and was looking for practical means to build a linear amplifier for these signals. At the time, short wave was anything above about 500\u00a0kHz, beyond any existing amplifier's capabilities.It had been noticed that when a regenerative receiver went into oscillation, other nearby receivers would start picking up other stations as well. Armstrong (and others) eventually deduced that this was caused by a \"supersonic heterodyne\" between the station's carrier frequency and the regenerative receiver's oscillation frequency. When the first receiver began to oscillate at high outputs, its signal would flow back out through the antenna to be received on any nearby receiver. On that receiver, the two signals mixed just as they did in the original heterodyne concept, producing an output that is the difference in frequency between the two signals.", "For instance, consider a lone receiver that was tuned to a station at 300\u00a0kHz. If a second receiver is set up nearby and set to 400\u00a0kHz with high gain, it will begin to give off a 400\u00a0kHz signal that will be received in the first receiver. In that receiver, the two signals will mix to produce four outputs, one at the original 300\u00a0kHz, another at the received 400\u00a0kHz, and two more, the difference at 100\u00a0kHz and the sum at 700\u00a0kHz. This is the same effect that Fessenden had proposed, but in his system the two frequencies were deliberately chosen so the beat frequency was audible. In this case, all of the frequencies are well beyond the audible range, and thus \"supersonic\", giving rise to the name superheterodyne.Armstrong realized that this effect was a potential solution to the \"short wave\" amplification problem, as the \"difference\" output still retained its original modulation, but on a lower carrier frequency. In the example above, one can amplify the 100\u00a0kHz beat signal and retrieve the original information from that, the receiver does not have to tune in the higher 300\u00a0kHz original carrier. By selecting an appropriate set of frequencies, even very high-frequency signals could be \"reduced\" to a frequency that could be amplified by existing systems.", "For instance, to receive a signal at 1500\u00a0kHz, far beyond the range of efficient amplification at the time, one could set up an oscillator at, for example, 1560\u00a0kHz. Armstrong referred to this as the \"local oscillator\" or LO. As its signal was being fed into a second receiver in the same device, it did not have to be powerful, generating only enough signal to be roughly similar in strength to that of the received station. When the signal from the LO mixes with the station's, one of the outputs will be the heterodyne difference frequency, in this case, 60\u00a0kHz. He termed this resulting difference the \"intermediate frequency\" often abbreviated to \"IF\".In December 1919, Major E. H. Armstrong gave publicity to an indirect method of obtaining short-wave amplification, called the super-heterodyne. The idea is to reduce the incoming frequency, which may be, for example 1,500,000 cycles (200 meters), to some suitable super-audible frequency that can be amplified efficiently, then passing this current through an intermediate frequency amplifier, and finally rectifying and carrying on to one or two stages of audio frequency amplification.The \"trick\" to the superheterodyne is that by changing the LO frequency you can tune in different stations. For instance, to receive a signal at 1300\u00a0kHz, one could tune the LO to 1360\u00a0kHz, resulting in the same 60\u00a0kHz IF. This means the amplifier section can be tuned to operate at a single frequency, the design IF, which is much easier to do efficiently.Development", "Armstrong put his ideas into practice, and the technique was soon adopted by the military. It was less popular when commercial radio broadcasting began in the 1920s, mostly due to the need for an extra tube (for the oscillator), the generally higher cost of the receiver, and the level of skill required to operate it. For early domestic radios, tuned radio frequency receivers (TRF) were more popular because they were cheaper, easier for a non-technical owner to use, and less costly to operate. Armstrong eventually sold his superheterodyne patent to Westinghouse, which then sold it to Radio Corporation of America (RCA), the latter monopolizing the market for superheterodyne receivers until 1930.", "Because the original motivation for the superhet was the difficulty of using the triode amplifier at high frequencies, there was an advantage in using a lower intermediate frequency. During this era, many receivers used an IF frequency of only 30\u00a0kHz. These low IF frequencies, often using IF transformers based on the self-resonance of iron-core transformers, had poor image frequency rejection, but overcame the difficulty in using triodes at radio frequencies in a manner that competed favorably with the less robust neutrodyne TRF receiver. Higher IF frequencies (455\u00a0kHz was a common standard) came into use in later years, after the invention of the tetrode and pentode as amplifying tubes, largely solving the problem of image rejection. Even later, however, low IF frequencies (typically 60\u00a0kHz) were again used in the second (or third) IF stage of double or triple-conversion communications receivers to take advantage of the selectivity more easily achieved at lower IF frequencies, with image-rejection accomplished in the earlier IF stage(s) which were at a higher IF frequency.", "In the 1920s, at these low frequencies, commercial IF filters looked very similar to 1920s audio interstage coupling transformers, had similar construction, and were wired up in an almost identical manner, so they were referred to as \"IF transformers\". By the mid-1930s, superheterodynes using much higher intermediate frequencies (typically around 440\u2013470\u00a0kHz) used tuned transformers more similar to other RF applications. The name \"IF transformer\" was retained, however, now meaning \"intermediate frequency\". Modern receivers typically use a mixture of ceramic resonators or surface acoustic wave resonators and traditional tuned-inductor IF transformers.By the 1930s, improvements in vacuum tube technology rapidly eroded the TRF receiver's cost advantages, and the explosion in the number of broadcasting stations created a demand for cheaper, higher-performance receivers.The introduction of an additional grid in a vacuum tube, but before the more modern screen-grid tetrode, included the tetrode with two control grids; this tube combined the mixer and oscillator functions, first used in the so-called autodyne mixer. This was rapidly followed by the introduction of tubes specifically designed for superheterodyne operation, most notably the pentagrid converter. By reducing the tube count (with each tube stage being the main factor affecting cost in this era), this further reduced the advantage of TRF and regenerative receiver designs.", "By the mid-1930s, commercial production of TRF receivers was largely replaced by superheterodyne receivers.  By the 1940s, the vacuum-tube superheterodyne AM broadcast receiver was refined into a cheap-to-manufacture design called the \"All American Five\" because it used five vacuum tubes: usually a converter (mixer/local oscillator), an IF amplifier, a detector/audio amplifier, audio power amplifier, and a rectifier.  Since this time, the superheterodyne design was used for almost all commercial radio and TV receivers.Patent battlesFrench engineer Lucien L\u00e9vy filed a patent application for the superheterodyne principle in August 1917 with brevet n\u00b0 493660. Armstrong also filed his patent in 1917.  Levy filed his original disclosure about seven months before Armstrong's.German inventor Walter H. Schottky also filed a patent in 1918.At first the US recognised Armstrong as the inventor, and his US Patent 1,342,885 was issued on 8 June 1920. After various changes and court hearings L\u00e9vy was awarded US patent No 1,734,938 that included seven of the nine claims in Armstrong's application, while the two remaining claims were granted to Alexanderson of GE and Kendall of AT&T.Principle of operationThe diagram at right shows the block diagram of a typical single-conversion superheterodyne receiver. The diagram has blocks that are common to superheterodyne receivers, with only the RF amplifier being optional.", "The antenna collects the radio signal. The tuned RF stage with optional RF amplifier provides some initial selectivity; it is necessary to suppress the image frequency (see below), and may also serve to prevent strong out-of-passband signals from saturating the initial amplifier. A local oscillator provides the mixing frequency; it is usually a variable frequency oscillator which is used to tune the receiver to different stations. The frequency mixer does the actual heterodyning that gives the superheterodyne its name; it changes the incoming radio frequency signal to a higher or lower, fixed, intermediate frequency (IF). The IF band-pass filter and amplifier supply most of the gain and the narrowband filtering for the radio. The demodulator extracts the audio or other modulation from the IF radio frequency. The extracted signal is then amplified by the audio amplifier.", "Circuit descriptionTo receive a radio signal, a suitable antenna is required. The output of the antenna may be very small, often only a few microvolts. The signal from the antenna is tuned and may be amplified in a so-called radio frequency (RF) amplifier, although this stage is often omitted. One or more tuned circuits at this stage block frequencies that are far removed from the intended reception frequency. To tune the receiver to a particular station, the frequency of the local oscillator is controlled by the tuning knob (for instance). Tuning of the local oscillator and the RF stage may use a variable capacitor, or varicap diode. The tuning of one (or more) tuned circuits in the RF stage must track the tuning of the local oscillator.", "Local oscillator and mixerThe signal is then fed into a circuit where it is mixed with a sine wave from a variable frequency oscillator known as the local oscillator (LO). The mixer uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat frequencies signals, each one containing the modulation contained in the desired signal. The output of the mixer may include the original RF signal at fRF, the local oscillator signal at fLO, and the two new heterodyne frequencies fRF\u00a0+\u00a0fLO and fRF\u00a0\u2212\u00a0fLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional frequencies such as third- and higher-order intermodulation products. Ideally, the IF bandpass filter removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF. The IF signal contains the original modulation (transmitted information) that the received radio signal had at fRF.The frequency of the local oscillator fLO is set so the desired reception radio frequency fRF mixes to fIF. There are two choices for the local oscillator frequency because the dominant mixer products are at fRF\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0fLO. If the local oscillator frequency is less than the desired reception frequency, it is called low-side injection (fIF = fRF \u2212 fLO); if the local oscillator is higher, then it is called high-side injection (fIF = fLO \u2212 fRF).", "The mixer will process not only the desired input signal at fRF, but also all signals present at its inputs. There will be many mixer products (heterodynes). Most other signals produced by the mixer (such as due to stations at nearby frequencies) can be filtered out in the IF tuned amplifier; that gives the superheterodyne receiver its superior performance. However, if fLO is set to fRF\u00a0+\u00a0fIF, then an incoming radio signal at fLO\u00a0+\u00a0fIF will also produce a heterodyne at fIF; the frequency  fLO\u00a0+\u00a0fIF is called the image frequency and must be rejected by the tuned circuits in the RF stage. The image frequency is 2\u00a0fIF higher (or lower) than the desired frequency fRF, so employing a higher IF frequency fIF increases the receiver's image rejection without requiring additional selectivity in the RF stage.", "To suppress the unwanted image, the tuning of the RF stage and the LO may need to \"track\" each other. In some cases, a narrow-band receiver can have a fixed tuned RF amplifier. In that case, only the local oscillator frequency is changed. In most cases, a receiver's input band is wider than its IF center frequency. For example, a typical AM broadcast band receiver covers 510\u00a0kHz to 1655\u00a0kHz (a roughly 1160\u00a0kHz input band) with a 455\u00a0kHz IF frequency; an FM broadcast band receiver covers 88\u00a0MHz to 108\u00a0MHz band with a 10.7\u00a0MHz IF frequency. In that situation, the RF amplifier must be tuned so the IF amplifier does not see two stations at the same time. If the AM broadcast band receiver LO were set at 1200\u00a0kHz, it would see stations at both 745\u00a0kHz (1200\u2212455\u00a0kHz) and 1655\u00a0kHz. Consequently, the RF stage must be designed so that any stations that are twice the IF frequency away are significantly attenuated. The tracking can be done with a multi-section variable capacitor or some varactors driven by a common control voltage. An RF amplifier may have tuned circuits at both its input and its output, so three or more tuned circuits may be tracked. In practice, the RF and LO frequencies need to track closely but not perfectly.", "In the days of tube (valve) electronics, it was common for superheterodyne receivers to combine the functions of the local oscillator and the mixer in a single tube, leading to a savings in power, size, and especially cost.  A single pentagrid converter tube would oscillate and also provide signal amplification as well as frequency mixing.IF amplifierThe stages of an intermediate frequency amplifier (\"IF amplifier\" or \"IF strip\") are tuned to a fixed frequency that does not change as the receiving frequency changes. The fixed frequency simplifies optimization of the IF amplifier. The IF amplifier is selective around its center frequency fIF. The fixed center frequency allows the stages of the IF amplifier to be carefully tuned for best performance (this tuning is called \"aligning\" the IF amplifier). If the center frequency changed with the receiving frequency, then the IF stages would have had to track their tuning. That is not the case with the superheterodyne.Normally, the IF center frequency fIF is chosen to be less than the range of desired reception frequencies fRF. That is because it is easier and less expensive to get high selectivity at a lower frequency using tuned circuits. The bandwidth of a tuned circuit with a certain Q is proportional to the frequency itself (and what's more, a higher Q is achievable at lower frequencies), so fewer IF filter stages are required to achieve the same selectivity. Also, it is easier and less expensive to get high gain at a lower frequencies.", "However, in many modern receivers designed for reception over a wide frequency range (e.g. scanners and spectrum analyzers) a first IF frequency higher than the reception frequency is employed in a  double conversion configuration. For instance, the Rohde & Schwarz EK-070 VLF/HF receiver covers 10\u00a0kHz to 30\u00a0MHz. It has a band switched RF filter and mixes the input to a first IF of 81.4\u00a0MHz and a second IF frequency of 1.4\u00a0MHz. The first LO frequency is 81.4 to 111.4\u00a0MHz, a reasonable range for an oscillator. But if the original RF range of the receiver were to be converted directly to the 1.4\u00a0MHz intermediate frequency, the LO frequency would need to cover 1.4-31.4\u00a0MHz which cannot be accomplished using tuned circuits (a variable capacitor with a fixed inductor would need a capacitance range of 500:1). Image rejection is never an issue with such a high IF frequency. The first IF stage uses a crystal filter with a 12\u00a0kHz bandwidth. There is a second frequency conversion (making a triple-conversion receiver) that mixes the 81.4\u00a0MHz first IF with 80\u00a0MHz to create a 1.4\u00a0MHz second IF. Image rejection for the second IF is not an issue as the first IF has a bandwidth of much less than 2.8\u00a0MHz.", "To avoid interference to receivers, licensing authorities will avoid assigning common IF frequencies to transmitting stations. Standard intermediate frequencies used are 455\u00a0kHz for medium-wave AM radio, 10.7\u00a0MHz for broadcast FM receivers, 38.9\u00a0MHz (Europe) or 45\u00a0MHz (US) for television, and 70\u00a0MHz for satellite and terrestrial microwave equipment. To avoid tooling costs associated with these components, most manufacturers then tended to design their receivers around a fixed range of frequencies offered, which resulted in a worldwide de facto standardization of intermediate frequencies.In early superhets, the IF stage was often a regenerative stage providing the sensitivity and selectivity with fewer components. Such superhets were called super-gainers or regenerodynes. This is also called a Q multiplier, involving a small modification to an existing receiver especially for the purpose of increasing selectivity.IF bandpass filterThe IF stage includes a filter and/or multiple tuned circuits to achieve the desired selectivity. This filtering must have a band pass equal to or less than the frequency spacing between adjacent broadcast channels. Ideally a filter would have a high attenuation to adjacent channels, but maintain a flat response across the desired signal spectrum in order to retain the quality of the received signal. This may be obtained using one or more dual tuned IF transformers, a quartz crystal filter, or a multipole ceramic crystal filter.", "In the case of television receivers, no other technique was able to produce the precise bandpass characteristic needed for vestigial sideband reception, such as that used in the NTSC system first approved by the US in 1941. By the 1980s, multi-component capacitor-inductor filters had been replaced with precision electromechanical surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters. Fabricated by precision laser milling techniques, SAW filters are cheaper to produce, can be made to extremely close tolerances, and are very stable in operation.DemodulatorThe received signal is now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires envelope detection, which can be achieved by means of rectification and a low-pass filter (which can be as simple as an RC circuit) to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called beat frequency oscillator, and there are other techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.", "When so-called high-side injection has been used, where the local oscillator is at a higher frequency than the received signal (as is common), then the frequency spectrum of the original signal will be reversed. This must be taken into account by the demodulator (and in the IF filtering) in the case of certain types of modulation such as single sideband.Multiple conversionTo overcome obstacles such as image response, some receivers use multiple successive stages of frequency conversion and multiple IFs of different values. A receiver with two frequency conversions and IFs is called a dual conversion superheterodyne, and one with three IFs is called a triple conversion superheterodyne.", "The main reason that this is done is that with a single IF there is a tradeoff between low image response and selectivity. The separation between the received frequency and the image frequency is equal to twice the IF frequency, so the higher the IF, the easier it is to design an RF filter to remove the image frequency from the input and achieve low image response. However, the higher the IF, the more difficult it is to achieve high selectivity in the IF filter. At shortwave frequencies and above, the difficulty in obtaining sufficient selectivity in the tuning with the high IFs needed for low image response impacts performance. To solve this problem two IF frequencies can be used, first converting the input frequency to a high IF to achieve low image response, and then converting this frequency to a low IF to achieve good selectivity in the second IF filter. To improve tuning, a third IF can be used.", "For example, for a receiver that can tune from 500\u00a0kHz to 30\u00a0MHz, three frequency converters might be used. With a 455\u00a0kHz IF it is easy to get adequate front end selectivity with broadcast band (under 1600\u00a0kHz) signals. For example, if the station being received is on 600\u00a0kHz, the local oscillator can be set to 1055 kHz, giving an image on (-600+1055=) 455\u00a0kHz. But a station on 1510\u00a0kHz could also potentially produce an image at (1510-1055=) 455\u00a0kHz and so cause image interference. However, because 600\u00a0kHz and 1510\u00a0kHz are so far apart, it is easy to design the front end tuning to reject the 1510\u00a0kHz frequency.However at 30\u00a0MHz, things are different. The oscillator would be set to 30.455\u00a0MHz to produce a 455\u00a0kHz IF, but a station on 30.910 would also produce a 455\u00a0kHz beat, so both stations would be heard at the same time. But it is virtually impossible to design an RF tuned circuit that can adequately discriminate between 30\u00a0MHz and 30.91\u00a0MHz, so one approach is to \"bulk downconvert\" whole sections of the shortwave bands to a lower frequency, where adequate front-end tuning is easier to arrange.", "For example, the ranges 29\u00a0MHz to 30\u00a0MHz; 28\u00a0MHz to 29\u00a0MHz etc. might be converted down to 2\u00a0MHz to 3\u00a0MHz, there they can be tuned more conveniently. This is often done by first converting each \"block\" up to a higher frequency (typically 40\u00a0MHz) and then using a second mixer to convert it down to the 2\u00a0MHz to 3\u00a0MHz range. The 2\u00a0MHz to 3\u00a0MHz \"IF\" is basically another self-contained superheterodyne receiver, most likely with a standard IF of 455\u00a0kHz.Modern designsMicroprocessor technology allows replacing the superheterodyne receiver design by a software defined radio architecture, where the IF processing after the initial IF filter is implemented in software. This technique is already in use in certain designs, such as very low-cost FM radios incorporated into mobile phones, since the system already has the necessary microprocessor.Radio transmitters may also use a mixer stage to produce an output frequency, working more or less as the reverse of a superheterodyne receiver.", "Advantages and disadvantagesSuperheterodyne receivers have essentially replaced all previous receiver designs. The development of modern semiconductor electronics negated the advantages of designs (such as the regenerative receiver) that used fewer vacuum tubes. The superheterodyne receiver offers superior sensitivity, frequency stability and selectivity. Compared with the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) design, superhets offer better stability because a tuneable oscillator is more easily realized than a tuneable amplifier. Operating at a lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same Q factor than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows the use of a crystal filter or similar technologies that cannot be tuned. Regenerative and super-regenerative receivers offered a high sensitivity, but often suffer from stability problems making them difficult to operate.Although the advantages of the superhet design are overwhelming, there are a few drawbacks that need to be tackled in practice.Image frequency (fIMAGE)", "One major disadvantage to the superheterodyne receiver is the problem of image frequency. In heterodyne receivers, an image frequency is an undesired input frequency equal to the station frequency plus (or minus) twice the intermediate frequency. The image frequency results in two stations being received at the same time, thus producing interference. Reception at the image frequency can be combated through tuning (filtering) at the antenna and RF stage of the superheterodyne receiver.For example, an AM broadcast station at 580\u00a0kHz is tuned on a receiver with a 455\u00a0kHz IF. The local oscillator is tuned to  1035\u00a0kHz. But a signal at  1490\u00a0kHz is also 455\u00a0kHz away from the local oscillator; so both the desired signal and the image, when mixed with the local oscillator, will appear at the intermediate frequency. This image frequency is within the AM broadcast band. Practical receivers have a tuning stage before the converter, to greatly reduce the amplitude of image frequency signals; additionally, broadcasting stations in the same area have their frequencies assigned to avoid such images.", "The unwanted frequency is called the image of the wanted frequency, because it is the \"mirror image\" of the desired frequency reflected about . A receiver with inadequate filtering at its input will pick up signals at two different frequencies simultaneously: the desired frequency and the image frequency. A radio reception which happens to be at the image frequency can interfere with reception of the desired signal, and noise (static) around the image frequency can decrease the receiver's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by up to 3dB. Early Autodyne receivers typically used IFs of only 150\u00a0kHz or so. As a consequence, most Autodyne receivers required greater front-end selectivity, often involving double-tuned coils, to avoid image interference. With the later development of tubes able to amplify well at higher frequencies, higher IF frequencies came into use, reducing the problem of image interference. Typical consumer radio receivers have only a single tuned circuit in the RF stage.", "Sensitivity to the image frequency can be minimized only by (1) a filter that precedes the mixer or (2) a more complex mixer circuit  to suppress the image; this is rarely used. In most tunable receivers using a single IF frequency, the RF stage includes at least one tuned circuit in the RF front end whose tuning is performed  in tandem with the local oscillator. In double (or triple) conversion receivers in which the first conversion uses a fixed local oscillator, this may rather be a fixed bandpass filter which accommodates the frequency range being mapped to the first IF frequency range.Image rejection is an important factor in choosing the intermediate frequency of a receiver. The farther apart the bandpass frequency and the image frequency are, the more the bandpass filter will attenuate any interfering image signal. Since the frequency separation between the bandpass and the image frequency is , a higher intermediate frequency improves image rejection. It may be possible to use a high enough first IF that a fixed-tuned RF stage can reject any image signals.The ability of a receiver to reject interfering signals at the image frequency is measured by the image rejection ratio. This is the ratio (in decibels) of the output of the receiver from a signal at the received frequency, to its output for an equal-strength signal at the image frequency.Local oscillator radiation", "It can be difficult to keep stray radiation from the local oscillator below the level that a nearby receiver can detect. If the receiver's local oscillator can reach the antenna it will act as a low-power CW transmitter. Consequently, what is meant to be a receiver can itself create radio interference.In intelligence operations, local oscillator radiation gives a means to detect a covert receiver and its operating frequency. The method was used by MI5 during Operation RAFTER. This same technique is also used in radar detector detectors used by traffic police in jurisdictions where radar detectors are illegal.Local oscillator radiation is most prominent in receivers in which the antenna signal is connected directly to the mixer (which itself receives the local oscillator signal) rather than from receivers in which an RF amplifier stage is used in between. Thus it is more of a problem with inexpensive receivers and with receivers at such high frequencies (especially microwave) where RF amplifying stages are difficult to implement.", "Local oscillator sideband noiseLocal oscillators typically generate a single frequency signal that has negligible amplitude modulation but some random phase modulation which spreads some of the signal's energy into sideband frequencies. That causes a corresponding widening of the receiver's frequency response, which would defeat the aim to make a very narrow bandwidth receiver such as to receive low-rate digital signals. Care needs to be taken to minimize oscillator phase noise, usually by ensuring that the oscillator never enters a non-linear mode.Terminology First detector, second detector The mixer tube or transistor is sometimes called the first detector, while the demodulator that extracts the modulation from the IF signal is called the second detector.  In a dual-conversion superhet there are two mixers, so the demodulator is called the third detector. RF front end Refers to all the components of the receiver up to and including the mixer; all the parts that process the signal at the original incoming radio frequency. In the block diagram above the RF front end components are colored red.See also H2X radar Automatic gain control Demodulator Direct conversion receiver VFO Single sideband modulation (demodulation) Tuned radio frequency receiver Reflex receiver Optical heterodyne detection Superheterodyne transmitterNotesReferencesFurther readingExternal links", "http://ethw.org/Superheterodyne_Receiver .

{"put": "id:en:doc::doc-en-289", "fields": {"id": "doc-en-289", "text": ["Heat transfer physics describes the kinetics of energy storage, transport, and  energy transformation by principal energy carriers: phonons (lattice vibration waves), electrons, fluid particles, and photons. Heat is energy stored in temperature-dependent motion of particles including electrons, atomic nuclei, individual atoms, and molecules. Heat is transferred to and from matter by the principal energy carriers. The state of energy stored within matter, or transported by the carriers, is described by a combination of classical and quantum statistical mechanics. The energy is different made (converted) among various carriers.The heat transfer processes (or kinetics) are governed by the rates at which various related physical phenomena occur, such as (for example) the rate of particle collisions in classical mechanics. These various states and kinetics determine the heat transfer, i.e., the net rate of energy storage or transport. Governing these process from the atomic level (atom or molecule length scale) to macroscale are the laws of thermodynamics, including conservation of energy.Introduction Heat is thermal energy associated with temperature-dependent motion of particles. The macroscopic energy equation for infinitesimal volume used in heat transfer analysis is", "where q is heat flux vector, -\u03c1cp(\u2202T/\u2202t) is temporal change of internal energy (\u03c1 is density, cp is specific heat capacity at constant pressure, T is temperature and t is time), and  is the energy conversion to and from thermal energy (i and j are for principal energy carriers).  So, the terms represent energy transport, storage and transformation.  Heat flux vector q is composed of three macroscopic fundamental modes, which are conduction (qk = -k\u2207T, k: thermal conductivity), convection (qu = \u03c1cpuT, u: velocity), and radiation (qr = s Iph,\u03c9 sin\u00a0\u03b8\u00a0d\u03b8\u00a0d\u03c9, \u03c9: angular frequency, \u03b8: polar angle, Iph,\u03c9: spectral, directional radiation intensity, s: unit vector), i.e., q = qk + qu + qr.Once states and kinetics of the energy conversion and thermophysical properties are known, the fate of heat transfer is described by the above equation. These atomic-level mechanisms and kinetics are addressed in heat transfer physics. The microscopic thermal energy is stored, transported, and transformed by the principal energy carriers: phonons (p), electrons (e), fluid particles (f), and photons (ph).Length and time scales", "Thermophysical properties of matter and the kinetics of interaction and energy exchange among the principal carriers are based on the atomic-level configuration and interaction. Transport properties such as thermal conductivity are calculated from these atomic-level properties using classical and quantum physics.  Quantum states of principal carriers (e.g.. momentum, energy) are derived from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (called first principle or ab initio) and the interaction rates (for kinetics) are calculated using the quantum states and the quantum perturbation theory (formulated as the Fermi golden rule).   Variety of ab initio (Latin for from the beginning) solvers (software) exist (e.g., ABINIT, CASTEP, Gaussian, Q-Chem, Quantum ESPRESSO, SIESTA, VASP, WIEN2k). Electrons in the inner shells (core) are not involved in heat transfer, and calculations are greatly reduced by proper approximations about the inner-shells electrons.", "The quantum treatments, including equilibrium and nonequilibrium ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), involving larger lengths and times are limited by the computation resources, so various alternate treatments with simplifying assumptions have been used and kinetics.  In classical (Newtonian) MD, the motion of atom or molecule (particles) is based on the empirical or effective interaction potentials, which in turn can be based on curve-fit of ab initio calculations or curve-fit to thermophysical properties. From the ensembles of simulated particles, static or dynamics thermal properties or scattering rates are derived.At yet larger length scales (mesoscale, involving many mean free paths), the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) which is based on the classical Hamiltonian-statistical mechanics is applied. BTE considers particle states in terms of position and momentum vectors (x, p) and this is represented as the state occupation probability.  The occupation has equilibrium distributions (the known boson, fermion, and Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann particles)  and transport of energy (heat) is due to nonequilibrium (cause by a driving force or potential). Central to the transport is the role of scattering which turn the distribution toward equilibrium. The scattering is presented by the relations time or the mean free path.  The relaxation time (or its inverse which is the interaction rate) is found from other calculations (ab initio or MD) or empirically.  BTE can be numerically solved with Monte Carlo method, etc.", "Depending on the length and time scale, the proper level of treatment (ab initio, MD, or BTE) is selected. Heat transfer physics analyses may involve multiple scales (e.g., BTE using interaction rate from ab initio or classical MD) with states and kinetic related to thermal energy storage, transport and transformation.So, heat transfer physics covers the four principal energy carries and their kinetics from classical and quantum mechanical perspectives. This enables multiscale (ab initio, MD, BTE and macroscale) analyses, including low-dimensionality and size effects.PhononPhonon (quantized lattice vibration wave) is a central thermal energy carrier contributing to heat capacity (sensible heat storage) and conductive heat transfer in condensed phase, and plays a very important role in thermal energy conversion. Its transport properties are represented by the phonon conductivity tensor Kp (W/m-K, from the Fourier law  qk,p = -Kp\u22c5\u2207 T) for bulk materials, and the phonon boundary resistance ARp,b [K/(W/m2)] for solid interfaces, where A is the interface area. The phonon specific heat capacity cv,p (J/kg-K) includes the quantum effect.  The thermal energy conversion rate involving phonon is included in .  Heat transfer physics describes and predicts, cv,p, Kp, Rp,b (or conductance Gp,b) and , based on atomic-level properties.", "For an equilibrium potential \u27e8\u03c6\u27e9o of a system with N atoms, the total potential \u27e8\u03c6\u27e9 is found by a Taylor series expansion at the equilibrium and this can be approximated by the second derivatives (the harmonic approximation) aswhere di is the displacement vector of atom i, and \u0393 is the spring (or force) constant as the second-order derivatives of the potential. The equation of motion for the lattice vibration in terms of the displacement of atoms [d(jl,t): displacement vector of the j-th atom in the l-th unit cell at time t] iswhere m is the atomic mass and \u0393 is the force constant tensor. The atomic displacement is the summation over the normal modes [s\u03b1: unit vector of mode \u03b1, \u03c9p: angular frequency of wave, and \u03bap: wave vector]. Using this plane-wave displacement, the equation of motion becomes the eigenvalue equationwhere M is the diagonal mass matrix and D is the harmonic dynamical matrix. Solving this eigenvalue equation gives the relation between the angular frequency \u03c9p and the wave vector \u03bap, and this relation is called the phonon dispersion relation.  Thus, the phonon dispersion relation is determined by matrices M and D, which depend on the atomic structure and the strength of interaction among constituent atoms (the stronger the interaction and the lighter the atoms, the higher is the phonon frequency and the larger is the slope d\u03c9p/d\u03bap).  The Hamiltonian of phonon system with the harmonic approximation is", "where Dij is the dynamical matrix element between atoms i and j, and di (dj) is the displacement of i (j) atom, and p is momentum. From this and the solution to dispersion relation, the phonon annihilation operator for the quantum treatment is defined aswhere N is the number of normal modes divided by \u03b1 and \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. The creation operator is the adjoint of the annihilation operator, The Hamiltonian in terms of b\u03ba,\u03b1\u2020 and b\u03ba,\u03b1 is Hp = \u03a3\u03ba,\u03b1\u0127\u03c9p,\u03b1[b\u03ba,\u03b1\u2020b\u03ba,\u03b1 + 1/2] and b\u03ba,\u03b1\u2020b\u03ba,\u03b1 is the phonon number operator. The energy of quantum-harmonic oscillator is Ep = \u03a3\u03ba,\u03b1 [fp(\u03ba,\u03b1) + 1/2]\u0127\u03c9p,\u03b1(\u03bap), and thus the quantum of phonon energy \u0127\u03c9p.The phonon dispersion relation gives all possible phonon modes within the Brillouin zone (zone within the primitive cell in reciprocal space), and the phonon density of states Dp (the number density of possible phonon modes). The phonon group velocity up,g is the slope of the dispersion curve, d\u03c9p/d\u03bap. Since phonon is a boson particle, its occupancy follows the Bose\u2013Einstein distribution {fpo = [exp(\u0127\u03c9p/kBT)-1]\u22121, kB: Boltzmann constant}.  Using the phonon density of states and this occupancy distribution, the phonon energy is Ep(T) = \u222bDp(\u03c9p)fp(\u03c9p,T)\u0127\u03c9pd\u03c9p, and the phonon density is np(T) = \u222bDp(\u03c9p)fp(\u03c9p,T)d\u03c9p. Phonon heat capacity cv,p (in solid cv,p = cp,p, cv,p : constant-volume heat capacity,  cp,p: constant-pressure heat capacity) is the temperature derivatives of phonon energy for the Debye model (linear dispersion model), is", "where TD is the Debye temperature, m is atomic mass, and n is the atomic number density (number density of phonon modes for the crystal 3n). This gives the Debye T3 law  at low temperature and Dulong-Petit law at high temperatures.From the kinetic theory of gases, thermal conductivity of principal carrier i (p, e, f and ph) iswhere ni  is the carrier density and the heat capacity is per carrier, ui is the carrier speed and \u03bbi is the mean free path (distance traveled by carrier before an scattering event). Thus, the larger the carrier density, heat capacity and speed, and the less significant the scattering, the higher is the conductivity. For phonon \u03bbp represents the interaction (scattering) kinetics of phonons and is related to the scattering relaxation time \u03c4p or rate   (= 1/\u03c4p) through \u03bbp= up\u03c4p. Phonons interact with other phonons, and with electrons, boundaries, impurities, etc., and \u03bbp combines these interaction mechanisms through the Matthiessen rule. At low temperatures, scattering by boundaries is dominant and with increase in temperature the interaction rate with impurities, electron and other phonons become important, and finally the phonon-phonon scattering dominants for T  >  0.2TD. The interaction rates are reviewed in  and includes quantum perturbation theory and MD.", "A number of conductivity models are available with approximations regarding the dispersion and \u03bbp. Using the single-mode relaxation time approximation (\u2202fp\u2032/\u2202t|s = -fp\u2032/\u03c4p) and the gas kinetic theory, Callaway phonon (lattice) conductivity model asWith the Debye model (a single group velocity up,g, and a specific heat capacity calculated above), this becomes where a is the lattice constant a = n\u22121/3 for a cubic lattice, and n is the atomic number density. Slack phonon conductivity model mainly considering acoustic phonon scattering (three-phonon interaction) is given aswhere \u27e8M\u27e9 is the mean atomic weight of the atoms in the primitive cell, Va=1/n is the average volume per atom, TD,\u221e is the high-temperature Debye temperature, T is the temperature, No is the number of atoms in the primitive cell, and \u27e8\u03b32G\u27e9 is the mode-averaged square of the Gr\u00fcneisen constant or parameter at high temperatures. This model is widely tested with pure nonmetallic crystals, and the overall agreement is good, even for complex crystals.", "Based on the kinetics and atomic structure consideration, a material with high crystalline and strong interactions, composed of light atoms (such as diamond and graphene) is expected to have large phonon conductivity. Solids with more than one atom in the smallest unit cell representing the lattice have two types of phonons, i.e., acoustic and optical. (Acoustic phonons are in-phase movements of atoms about their equilibrium positions, while optical phonons are out-of-phase movement of adjacent atoms in the lattice.) Optical phonons have higher energies (frequencies), but make smaller contribution to conduction heat transfer, because of their smaller group velocity and occupancy.Phonon transport across hetero-structure boundaries (represented with Rp,b, phonon boundary resistance) according to the boundary scattering approximations are modeled as acoustic and diffuse mismatch models. Larger phonon transmission (small Rp,b) occurs at boundaries where material pairs have similar phonon properties (up, Dp, etc.), and in contract large Rp,b occurs when some material is softer (lower cut-off phonon frequency) than the other.Electron", "Quantum electron energy states for electron are found using the electron quantum Hamiltonian, which is generally composed of kinetic (-\u01272\u22072/2me) and potential energy terms (\u03c6e). Atomic orbital, a mathematical function describing the wave-like behavior of either an electron or a pair of electrons in an atom, can be found from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with this electron Hamiltonian. Hydrogen-like atoms (a nucleus and an electron) allow for closed-form solution to Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the electrostatic potential (the Coulomb law). The Schr\u00f6dinger equation of atoms or atomic ions with more than one electron has not been solved analytically, because of the Coulomb interactions among electrons. Thus, numerical techniques are used, and an electron configuration is approximated as product of simpler hydrogen-like atomic orbitals (isolate electron orbitals). Molecules with multiple atoms (nuclei and their electrons) have molecular orbital (MO, a mathematical function for the wave-like behavior of an electron in a molecule),  and are obtained from simplified solution techniques such as  linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The molecular orbital is used to predict chemical and physical properties, and the difference between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is a measure of excitability of the molecules.", "In a crystal structure of  metallic solids, the free electron model (zero potential, \u03c6e = 0) for the behavior of valence electrons is used. However, in a periodic lattice (crystal), there is periodic crystal potential, so the electron Hamiltonian becomeswhere me is the electron mass, and the periodic potential is expressed as \u03c6c (x) = \u03a3g \u03c6gexp[i(g\u2219x)] (g: reciprocal lattice vector).  The time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation with this Hamiltonian is given as (the eigenvalue equation)", "where the eigenfunction \u03c8e,\u03ba is the electron wave function, and eigenvalue Ee(\u03bae), is the electron energy (\u03bae: electron wavevector).  The relation between wavevector, \u03bae and energy Ee provides the electronic band structure.  In practice, a lattice as many-body systems  includes interactions between electrons and nuclei in potential, but this calculation can be too intricate. Thus, many approximate techniques have been suggested and one of them is density functional theory (DFT), uses functionals of the spatially dependent electron density instead of full interactions. DFT is widely used in ab initio software (ABINIT, CASTEP, Quantum ESPRESSO, SIESTA, VASP, WIEN2k, etc.). The electron specific heat is based on the energy states and occupancy distribution (the Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics).  In general, the heat capacity of electron is small except at very high temperature when they are in thermal equilibrium with phonons (lattice). Electrons contribute to heat conduction (in addition to charge carrying) in solid, especially in metals. Thermal conductivity tensor in solid is the sum of electric and phonon thermal conductivity tensors K = Ke + Kp.", "Electrons are affected by two thermodynamic forces [from the charge, \u2207(EF/ec) where EF is the Fermi level and ec is the electron charge and temperature gradient, \u2207(1/T)] because they carry both charge and thermal energy, and thus electric current je and heat flow q are described with the thermoelectric tensors (Aee, Aet, Ate, and Att) from the Onsager reciprocal relations asConverting these equations to have je equation in terms of electric field ee and \u2207T and q equation with je and \u2207T, (using scalar coefficients for isotropic transport, \u03b1ee, \u03b1et, \u03b1te, and \u03b1tt instead of Aee, Aet, Ate, and Att)Electrical conductivity/resistivity  \u03c3e (\u03a9\u22121m\u22121)/ \u03c1e (\u03a9-m), electric thermal conductivity ke (W/m-K) and the Seebeck/Peltier coefficients \u03b1S (V/K)/\u03b1P (V) are defined as,", "Various carriers (electrons, magnons, phonons, and polarons) and their interactions substantially affect the Seebeck coefficient.   The Seebeck coefficient can be decomposed with two contributions, \u03b1S = \u03b1S,pres + \u03b1S,trans, where \u03b1S,pres is the sum of contributions to the carrier-induced entropy change, i.e., \u03b1S,pres = \u03b1S,mix + \u03b1S,spin + \u03b1S,vib (\u03b1S,mix: entropy-of-mixing, \u03b1S,spin: spin entropy, and \u03b1S,vib: vibrational entropy). The other contribution \u03b1S,trans is the net energy transferred in moving a carrier divided by qT (q: carrier charge). The electron's contributions to the Seebeck coefficient are mostly in \u03b1S,pres. The \u03b1S,mix is usually dominant in lightly doped semiconductors. The change of the entropy-of-mixing upon adding an electron to a system is the so-called Heikes formula", "where feo = N/Na is the ratio of electrons to sites (carrier concentration). Using the chemical potential (\u03bc), the thermal energy (kBT) and the Fermi function, above equation can be expressed in an alternative form, \u03b1S,mix =  (kB/q)[(Ee - \u03bc)/(kBT)].Extending the Seebeck effect to spins, a ferromagnetic alloy can be a good example. The contribution to the Seebeck coefficient that results from electrons' presence altering the systems spin entropy is given by \u03b1S,spin = \u0394Sspin/q = (kB/q)ln[(2s + 1)/(2s0 +1)], where s0 and s are net spins of the magnetic site in the absence and presence of the carrier, respectively. Many vibrational effects with electrons also contribute to the Seebeck coefficient. The softening of the vibrational frequencies produces a change of the vibrational entropy is one of examples. The vibrational entropy is the negative derivative of the free energy, i.e.,where Dp(\u03c9) is the phonon density-of-states for the structure. For the high-temperature limit and series expansions of the hyperbolic functions, the above is simplified as \u03b1S,vib = (\u0394Svib/q) = (kB/q)\u03a3i(-\u0394\u03c9i/\u03c9i).The Seebeck coefficient derived in the above Onsager formulation is the mixing component \u03b1S,mix, which dominates in most semiconductors. The vibrational component in high-band gap materials such as B13C2 is very important.Considering the microscopic transport ( transport is a results of nonequilibrium),", "where ue is the electron velocity vector, fe (feo) is the electron nonequilibrium (equilibrium) distribution, \u03c4e is the electron scattering time, Ee is the electron energy, and Fte is the electric and thermal forces from \u2207(EF/ec) and \u2207(1/T).Relating the thermoelectric coefficients to the microscopic transport equations for je and q, the thermal, electric, and thermoelectric properties are calculated. Thus, ke increases with the electrical conductivity \u03c3e and temperature T, as the Wiedemann\u2013Franz law presents [ke/(\u03c3eTe) = (1/3)(\u03c0kB/ec)2 = 2.44\u00d710\u22128 W-\u03a9/K2].   Electron transport (represented as \u03c3e) is a function of carrier density ne,c and electron mobility \u03bce (\u03c3e = ecne,c\u03bce).   \u03bce is determined by electron scattering rates  (or relaxation time, ) in various interaction mechanisms including interaction with other electrons, phonons, impurities and boundaries.", "Electrons interact with other principal energy carriers. Electrons accelerated by an electric field are relaxed through the energy conversion to phonon (in semiconductors, mostly optical phonon), which is called Joule heating. Energy conversion between electric potential and phonon energy is considered in thermoelectrics such as Peltier cooling and thermoelectric generator.  Also, study of interaction with photons is central in optoelectronic applications (i.e. light-emitting diode, solar photovoltaic cells, etc.). Interaction rates or energy conversion rates can be evaluated using the Fermi golden rule (from the perturbation theory) with ab initio approach.Fluid particle", "Fluid particle is the smallest unit (atoms or molecules) in the fluid phase (gas, liquid or plasma) without breaking any chemical bond. Energy of fluid particle is divided into potential, electronic, translational, vibrational, and rotational energies. The heat (thermal) energy storage in fluid particle is through the temperature-dependent particle motion (translational, vibrational, and rotational energies). The electronic energy is included only if temperature is high enough to ionize or dissociate the fluid particles or to include other electronic transitions. These quantum energy states of the fluid particles are found using their respective quantum Hamiltonian. These are Hf,t = -(\u01272/2m)\u22072, Hf,v = -(\u01272/2m)\u22072 + \u0393x2/2 and Hf,r = -(\u01272/2If)\u22072 for translational, vibrational and rotational modes. (\u0393: spring constant, If: the moment of inertia for the molecule). From the Hamiltonian, the quantized fluid particle energy state Ef and partition functions Zf [with the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann (MB) occupancy distribution] are found asHere, gf is the degeneracy, n, l, and  j are the transitional, vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, Tf,v is the characteristic temperature for vibration (= \u0127\u03c9f,v/kB, : vibration frequency), and Tf,r is the rotational temperature [= \u01272/(2IfkB)]. The average specific internal energy is related to the partition function through Zf,", "With the energy states and the partition function, the fluid particle specific heat capacity cv,f is the summation of contribution from various kinetic energies (for non-ideal gas the potential energy is also added). Because the total degrees of freedom in molecules is determined by the atomic configuration, cv,f  has different formulas depending on the configuration,where Rg is the gas constant (= NAkB, NA: the Avogadro constant) and M is the molecular mass (kg/kmol). (For the polyatomic ideal gas, No is the number of atoms in a molecule.) In gas, constant-pressure specific heat capacity cp,f has a larger value and the difference depends on the temperature T, volumetric thermal expansion coefficient \u03b2 and the isothermal compressibility \u03ba [cp,f  \u2013 cv,f  = T\u03b22/(\u03c1f\u03ba), \u03c1f : the fluid density].  For dense fluids that the interactions between the particles (the van der Waals interaction) should be included, and cv,f and cp,f would change accordingly.The net motion of particles (under gravity or external pressure) gives rise to the convection heat flux qu = \u03c1fcp,fufT. Conduction heat flux qk for ideal gas is derived with the gas kinetic theory or the Boltzmann transport equations, and the thermal conductivity is", "where \u27e8uf2\u27e91/2 is the RMS (root mean square) thermal velocity (3kBT/m from the MB distribution function, m: atomic mass) and \u03c4f-f is the relaxation time (or intercollision time period) [(21/2\u03c0 d2nf \u27e8uf\u27e9)\u22121 from the gas kinetic theory, \u27e8uf\u27e9: average thermal speed (8kBT/\u03c0m)1/2, d: the collision diameter of fluid particle (atom or molecule), nf: fluid number density].kf is also calculated using molecular dynamics (MD), which simulates physical movements of the fluid particles with the Newton equations of motion (classical) and force field (from ab initio or empirical properties). For calculation of kf, the equilibrium MD with Green\u2013Kubo relations, which express the transport coefficients in terms of integrals of time correlation functions (considering fluctuation), or nonequilibrium MD (prescribing heat flux or temperature difference in simulated system) are generally employed.", "Fluid particles can interact with other principal particles. Vibrational or rotational modes, which have relatively high energy, are excited or decay through the interaction with photons. Gas lasers employ the interaction kinetics between fluid particles and photons, and laser cooling has been also considered in CO2 gas laser. Also, fluid particles can be adsorbed on solid surfaces (physisorption and chemisorption), and the frustrated vibrational modes in adsorbates (fluid particles) is decayed by creating e\u2212-h+ pairs or phonons.  These interaction rates are also calculated through ab initio calculation on fluid particle and the Fermi golden rule.Photon Photon is the quanta of electromagnetic (EM) radiation and energy carrier for radiation heat transfer. The EM wave is governed by the classical Maxwell equations, and the quantization of EM wave is used for phenomena such as the blackbody radiation (in particular to explain the ultraviolet catastrophe). The quanta EM wave (photon) energy of angular frequency \u03c9ph is Eph = \u0127\u03c9ph, and follows the Bose\u2013Einstein distribution function (fph).

Lasers range far-infrared to X-rays/\u03b3-rays regimes based on the resonant transition (stimulated emission) between electronic energy states.Near-field radiation from thermally excited dipoles and other electric/magnetic transitions is very effective within a short distance (order of wavelength) from emission sites.", "The BTE for photon particle momentum pph = \u0127\u03c9phs/uph along direction s experiencing absorption/emission  (= uph\u03c3ph,\u03c9[fph(\u03c9ph,T) - fph(s)], \u03c3ph,\u03c9: spectral absorption coefficient), and generation/removal  , isIn terms of radiation intensity (Iph,\u03c9 = uphfph\u0127\u03c9phDph,\u03c9/4\u03c0, Dph,\u03c9: photon density of states), this is called the equation of radiative transfer (ERT) The net radiative heat flux vector is From the Einstein population rate equation, spectral absorption coefficient \u03c3ph,\u03c9 in ERT is,where  is the interaction probability (absorption) rate or the Einstein coefficient B12 (J\u22121 m3 s\u22121), which gives the probability per unit time per unit spectral energy density of the radiation field (1: ground state, 2: excited state), and ne is electron density (in ground state). This can be obtained using the transition dipole moment \u03bce with the FGR and relationship between Einstein coefficients. Averaging \u03c3ph,\u03c9 over \u03c9 gives the average photon absorption coefficient \u03c3ph.For the case of optically thick medium of length L, i.e., \u03c3phL >> 1,  and using the gas kinetic theory, the photon conductivity kph  is 16\u03c3SBT3/3\u03c3ph (\u03c3SB: Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant, \u03c3ph: average photon absorption), and photon heat capacity nphcv,ph is 16\u03c3SBT3/uph.", "Photons have the largest range of energy and central in a variety of energy conversions. Photons interact with electric and magnetic entities. For example, electric dipole which in turn are excited by optical phonons or fluid particle vibration, or transition dipole moments of electronic transitions. In heat transfer physics, the interaction kinetics of phonon is treated using the perturbation theory (the Fermi golden rule) and the interaction Hamiltonian. The photon-electron interaction iswhere pe is the dipole moment vector and a\u2020 and a are the creation and annihilation of internal motion of electron.  Photons also participate in ternary interactions, e.g., phonon-assisted photon absorption/emission (transition of electron energy level). The vibrational mode in fluid particles can decay or become excited by emitting or absorbing photons. Examples are solid and molecular gas laser cooling.Using ab initio calculations based on the first principles along with EM theory, various radiative properties such as dielectric function (electrical permittivity, \u03b5e,\u03c9), spectral absorption coefficient (\u03c3ph,\u03c9), and the complex refraction index (m\u03c9), are calculated for various interactions between photons and electric/magnetic entities in matter. For example, the imaginary part (\u03b5e,c,\u03c9) of complex dielectric function (\u03b5e,\u03c9 = \u03b5e,r,\u03c9 + i \u03b5e,c,\u03c9) for electronic transition across a bandgap is", "where V is the unit-cell volume, VB and CB denote the valence and conduction bands, w\u03ba is the weight associated with a \u03ba-point, and pij is the transition momentum matrix element.The real part is \u03b5e,r,\u03c9 is obtained from \u03b5e,c,\u03c9 using the Kramers-Kronig relationHere,  denotes the principal value of the integral.In another example, for the far IR regions where the optical phonons are involved, the dielectric function (\u03b5e,\u03c9) are calculated aswhere LO and TO denote the longitudinal and transverse optical phonon modes, j is all the IR-active modes, and \u03b3 is the temperature-dependent damping term in the oscillator model. \u03b5e,\u221e is high frequency dielectric permittivity, which can be calculated DFT calculation when ions are treated as external potential.From these dielectric function (\u03b5e,\u03c9) calculations (e.g., Abinit, VASP, etc.), the complex refractive index m\u03c9(= n\u03c9 + i \u03ba\u03c9, n\u03c9: refraction index and \u03ba\u03c9: extinction index) is found, i.e., m\u03c92 = \u03b5e,\u03c9 = \u03b5e,r,\u03c9 + i \u03b5e,c,\u03c9).

{"put": "id:en:doc::doc-en-458054", "fields": {"id": "doc-en-458054", "text": ["In radio, longwave,  long wave or long-wave, and commonly abbreviated LW, refers to parts of the radio spectrum with wavelengths longer than what was originally called the medium-wave broadcasting band. The term is historic, dating from the early 20th century, when the radio spectrum was considered to consist of longwave (LW), medium-wave (MW), and short-wave (SW) radio bands. Most modern radio systems and devices use wavelengths which would then have been considered 'ultra-short'.In contemporary usage, the term longwave is not defined precisely, and its intended meaning varies. It may be used for radio wavelengths longer than 1,000\u00a0m i.e. frequencies up to 300\u00a0kilohertz (kHz), including the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU's) low frequency (LF, 30\u2013300\u00a0kHz) and very low frequency (VLF, 3\u201330\u00a0kHz) bands. Sometimes the upper limit is taken to be higher than 300\u00a0kHz, but not above the start of the medium wave broadcast band at 520\u00a0kHz.In Europe, Africa, and large parts of Asia (International Telecommunication Union Region 1), where a range of frequencies between 148.5 and 283.5\u00a0kHz is used for AM broadcasting in addition to the medium-wave band, the term longwave usually refers specifically to this broadcasting band, which falls wholly within the low frequency band of the radio spectrum (30\u2013300\u00a0kHz). The \"Longwave Club of America\" (United States) is interested in \"frequencies below the AM broadcast band\" (i.e., all frequencies below 520\u00a0kHz).", "Propagation Because of their long wavelength, radio waves in this frequency range can diffract over obstacles like mountain ranges and travel beyond the horizon, following the contour of the Earth. This mode of propagation, called ground wave, is the main mode in the longwave band. The attenuation of signal strength with distance by absorption in the ground is lower than at higher frequencies, and falls with frequency. Low frequency ground waves can be received up to  from the transmitting antenna.  Very low frequency waves below 30\u00a0kHz can be used to communicate at transcontinental distances, and can penetrate saltwater to depths of hundreds of feet, and is used by the military to communicate with submerged submarines.Low frequency waves can also occasionally travel long distances by reflecting from the ionosphere (the actual mechanism is one of refraction), although this method, called skywave or \"skip\" propagation, is not as common as at higher frequencies. Reflection occurs at the ionospheric E layer or F layers.  Skywave signals can be detected at distances exceeding  from the transmitting antenna.Non-broadcast useNon-directional beaconsNon-directional beacons transmit continuously for the benefit of radio direction finders in marine and aeronautical navigation.  They identify themselves by a callsign in Morse code.  They can occupy any frequency in the range 190\u20131750\u00a0kHz.  In North America, they occupy 190\u2013535\u00a0kHz.  In ITU Region 1 the lower limit is 280\u00a0kHz.", "Time signalsThere are institutional broadcast stations in the range that transmit coded time signals to radio clocks. For example:WWVB in Colorado, United States, on 60\u00a0kHz, 70 kW ERPDCF77 in Frankfurt, Germany, on 77.5\u00a0kHz, 50 kWJJY in Japan, on 40 & 60\u00a0kHz, 50 kWRBU 66.66\u00a0kHz in Taldom transmitter, Russia, 10 kWBPC in Lintong, China, 68.5\u00a0kHz, 90 kWMSF time and 60\u00a0kHz frequency standard transmitted from Anthorn in the UK, 17 kW ERP.TDF from Allouis, France, on 162\u00a0kHz, 800 kWRadio-controlled clocks receive their time calibration signals with built-in long-wave receivers. They use long-wave, rather than short-wave or medium-wave, because long-wave signals from the transmitter to the receiver always travel along the same direct path across the surface of the Earth, so the time delay correction for the signal travel time from the transmitting station to the receiver is always the same for any one receiving location.", "Longwaves travel by groundwaves that hug the surface of the earth, unlike mediumwaves and shortwaves. Those higher-frequency signals do not follow the surface of the Earth beyond a few kilometers, but can travel as skywaves, \u2018bouncing\u2019 off different layers of the ionosphere at different times of day. These different propagation paths can make the time lag different for every signal received. The delay between when the long-wave signal was sent from the transmitter (when the coded time was correct) and when the signal is received by the clock (when the coded time is slightly late) depends on the overland distance between the clock and the transmitter and the speed of light through the air, which is also very nearly constant. Since the time lag is essentially the same, a single constant shift forward from the time coded in the signal can compensate for all long-wave signals received at any one location from the same time signal station.Submarine communicationThe militaries of the United Kingdom, Russian Federation, United States, Germany, India and Sweden use frequencies below 50\u00a0kHz to communicate with submerged submarines.LowFERLicensed operators in the U.S. may transmit on the newly-allocated 2200\u00a0m band from 136\u2013139\u00a0kHz at maximum equivalent power radiated from the antenna of 1\u00a0watt (EIRP); most nations in Europe already have adopted the new band, along with many others worldwide.", "In North America during the 1970s, the frequencies 167, 179, and 191\u00a0kHz were assigned to the short-lived Public Emergency Radio of the United States.Nowadays, in the United States, Part 15 of FCC regulations allow unlicensed use of the 160\u2013190\u00a0kHz band a transmitter / amplifier output power to the antenna of at most 1\u00a0watt, with an antenna at most 15\u00a0meters (49\u00a0feet) high; this is called Low Frequency Experimental Radio (LowFER). The 190\u2013435\u00a0kHz band is used for navigational beacons.Frequencies from 472\u2013479\u00a0kHz are available to licensed amateurs as the new 630\u00a0m band, part of the now-defunct maritime band, but this is often considered a medium wave sub-band.HistoricSwedish station SAQ, located at the Varberg Radio Station facility in Grimeton, is the last remaining operational Alexanderson alternator long-wave transmitter. Although the station ended regular service in 1996, it has been maintained as a World Heritage Site, and makes at least two demonstration transmissions yearly, on 17.2\u00a0kHz.BroadcastingLongwave is used for broadcasting only within ITU Region 1. The long-wave broadcasters are located in western, northern, central, and southeastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Mongolia, Algeria, and Morocco.Typically, a larger geographic area can be covered by a long-wave broadcast transmitter compared to a medium-wave one. This is because ground-wave propagation suffers less attenuation due to ground conductivity at lower frequencies.", "Carrier frequenciesLong-wave carrier frequencies are exact multiples of 9\u00a0kHz; ranging from 153 to 279\u00a0kHz, except for a French-language station, Europe No. 1 in Germany. This station kept correctly spaced channels spacing for 4 months\u2014only 7 years ago, and all Mongolian transmitters are 2\u00a0kHz above the internationally recognized channels.Until the 1970s, some long-wave stations in northern and eastern Europe and the Soviet Union operated on frequencies as high as 433\u00a0kHz.Some radio broadcasters, for instance Droitwich transmitting station in the UK, derive their carrier frequencies from an atomic clock, allowing their use as frequency standards.  Droitwich also broadcasts a low bit-rate data channel, using narrow-shift phase-shift keying of the carrier, for Radio Teleswitch Services.In 2014 and 2015 Russia closed all of its LW broadcast transmitters.Long-distance receptionBecause long-wave signals can travel very long distances, some radio amateurs and shortwave listeners engage in an activity called DXing. DXers attempt to listen in to far away transmissions, and they will often send a reception report to the sending station to let them know where they were heard.  After receiving a report, the sending station may mail the listener a QSL card to acknowledge this reception.Reception of long-wave signals at distances in excess of  have been verified.List of long-wave broadcasting transmittersSee also", "Low frequency: for other uses (military, commercial and amateur) of this part of the radio spectrum (30\u2013300\u00a0kHz) Electromagnetic spectrum: Very low frequency, Shortwave, Ground wave, Skywave, Medium wave Radio broadcasting: AM broadcasting, BBC Radio 4, BBC Light Programme, Radio clock, Office de Radiodiffusion-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise, Warsaw radio mast, Digital Radio Mondiale, International broadcasting, Shipping: Global navigation satellite system, Navigation, Shipping Forecast Lists: Index of wave articles Other: 1 kilometre, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Fail-safe, WGU-20NotesReferencesExternal links  Tomislav Stimac, \"Definition of frequency bands (VLF, ELF... etc.)\".

The conflict escalated when militants who were affiliated with the Islamic State killed Abdul Ghani, a senior Taliban commander in Logar province on 2 February 2015. Since then, Taliban and the Islamic State have engaged in clashes over the control of territory, mostly in eastern Afghanistan, but clashes have also occurred between the Taliban and the Islamic State's cells which are located in the north-west and south-west.The Haqqani network, Al-Qaeda and others support the Taliban, while IS is supported by the High Council of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the Mullah Dadullah Front and the pro-ISIS faction of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. After the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban in 2021, several members of the Afghan intelligence agency and the Afghan national army have also joined the Islamic State \u2013 Khorasan Province.", "Background During the first stint in power of the  Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan during 1996\u20132001, the ruling Taliban had pursued a policy of suppressing Salafism; motivated by strict Deobandi tenets. During this period, the main issue of Salafist scholars was that Taliban was led by Maturidi Sufis. As a result of the unofficial Taliban bans on Ahl-i Hadith during the 1996-2001 era, several Salafis had shifted to Peshawar. However, after the US Invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, Taliban and Ahl-i Hadith allied to wage a common Jihad to resist the invasion. The Afghan Salafists decided to put aside their differences with the Taliban to join them in the \u201cgreater jihad\u201d against the United States. Several Arab Salafis in Al-Qaeda rank and file would mediate the disputes between Afghan Salafists and Taliban; enabling them to unify for the more important religious duty of fighting against the U.S and its allies in Afghanistan.  Many Salafi commanders and Ahl-i Hadith organisations participated in the Taliban insurgency (2001-2021) under Afghan Taliban's command.", "During the Taliban insurgency, in January 2015, IS established itself in Khorasan and formed IS-K. The main objective of IS-K was to occupy the land of Khorasan, that includes the country of Afghanistan. Even though the initial IS-K was formed by Taliban as well as Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) defectors and thus ideologically similar, it became dominated by Salafists. The disgruntled members of TTP would establish IS-KP and shifted to the Nangarhar province. After its founding Pakistani leaders who defected from TTP were killed in US drone strikes, Afghan Salafists took charge of TTP.The emergence of IS-K provided militant Afghan Salafists with an opportunity to set up a rival force, although Salafist support for the group waned as it proved ideologically \"too extreme and brutal\" for most Afghan Salafis. As a result, majority of Afghan Salafis have remained supportive of the Taliban. In March 2020, major Pashtun Ahl-i Hadith ulema convened in Peshawar under the leadership of Shaikh Abdul Aziz Nooristani and Haji Hayatullah to pledge Bay'ah (oath of loyalty) to the Taliban and publicly condemn IS-K. The scholars also requested protection from the Afghan Taliban for the Ahl-i Hadith community.", "After Taliban victory in the War in Afghanistan and Restoration of the Islamic Emirate, hundreds of Ahl-i Hadith ulema would gather to announce their Bay'ah (pledge of allegiance) to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Numerous Ahl-i Hadith clerics and their representatives held gatherings across various provinces of Afghanistan to re-affirm their backing of the Taliban and officially declare their support to the Taliban crackdown on IS-K.Opposing forces By 2016, IS-K mostly consisted of eastern Afghans, Pakistanis, and foreign fighters from Central Asia. The latter were mainly former members of the Islamic Jihad Union and the Turkistan Islamic Party. In addition, there were a small number of Arabs. Throughout its existence, IS-K has operated in a very limited area, mainly concentrated in select provinces in eastern Afghanistan, most importantly Nangarhar and Kunar. By 2016, it had appointed shadow governors in other regions as well, but not exerted much influence outside its traditional bases. The group is known to receive support by the Islamic State's central command in form of money and combat trainers from Iraq and Syria. IS-K's combat strength has fluctuated greatly over the years, but has mostly remained in the low thousands.During the Taliban insurgency2015On 2 February, militants affiliated with IS-K killed Abdul Ghani, a Taliban commander, in Logar province.", "On 26 May, Asif Nang, governor of Farah province, said the Taliban have been fighting against IS militants for the past three days in Farah province. The clash left 10 Taliban and 15 IS militants dead.In May, IS-K militants captured Maulvi Abbas, a Taliban commander who was leading a small squad of insurgent fighters in Nangarhar province.In June, IS-K militants beheaded 10 Taliban fighters who were fleeing an Afghan military offensive according to a spokesman of Afghan army corps responsible for the region.On 9 November, fighting had broken out between different Taliban factions in the Zabul Province of Afghanistan. Fighters loyal to the new Taliban leader Akhtar Mansour began to fight a pro-IS faction, led by Mullah Mansoor Dadullah. According to Afghan security and local officials, Akhtar Mansour had sent as many as 450 Taliban fighters to crush Mullah Mansoor and Islamic State elements in Zabul. Dadullah's faction received support from IS during the clashes, and IS fighters also joined in on the fighting alongside Dadullah, including foreign fighters from Chechnya and Uzbekistan. Dadullah and IS were eventually defeated by Mansour's forces. Hajji Momand Nasratyar, the district governor of Arghandab, said the fighting took place in three districts of Zabul province and 86 IS militants and 26 Taliban fighters were killed in the clash. Taliban also reported to have killed several IS militants who were responsible for beheading of seven Hazara civilians a few days back.", "Hajji Atta Jan, the Zabul provincial council chief, said the offensive by Mullah Mansour's fighters was so intense, that at least three Islamic State commanders, all of them ethnic Uzbeks, had surrendered. They were also asking others IS militants to do the same. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, while quoting sources from Southern Afghanistan, reported that some 70 IS militants were also captured in the clash by the Taliban.On 13 November, Ghulam Jelani Farahi, an Afghan police chief, said that Mullah Mansoor Dadullah was killed in a clash with Taliban.2016In January, hundreds of Taliban fighters launched an assault against IS bases in eastern Afghanistan. Taliban fighters were successful in capturing two districts from IS in eastern Afghanistan, but it failed to drive the group out of their stronghold in the Nazyan district in Nangarhar province. Ataullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said that 26 IS militants and 5 Taliban fighters were killed in the clashes in Nangarhar.On 2 February, US carried out airstrikes targeting IS radio station in eastern Afghanistan. The strike destroyed the radio station and killed 29 IS militants.In March, Taliban factions led by Muhammad Rasul and opposed to Mansoor, began to fight against his loyalists in the group. During the fighting, dozens were reported killed.", "On 26 April, Hazrat Hussain Mashriqwal, a provincial police spokesman, said that 10 IS militants, including an IS commander, and 6 Taliban fighters were killed in a clash in Nangarhar. 15 IS militants and 4 Taliban fighters were also wounded during the same clash according to the spokesman.On 19 May, local government officials reported that a clash took place between IS and Taliban in Achin and Khogyani district of Nangarhar province. 15 IS militants and 3 Taliban fighters were killed in Achin district, and the remaining were killed in Khogyani. 4 Taliban commanders were also among the dead.On 13 August, US defence officials said that ISIL's top leader, Hafiz Saeed Khan, was killed in a drone strike on 26 July in Nangarhar province.On 30 October, Ajmal Zahid, a governor of Golestan district, said that ISIL's commander, Abdul Razaq Mehdi, was killed by Taliban fighters in Farah province.2017On 13 April 2017, the United States dropped the largest non-nuclear bomb, known as the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) Mother of All Bombs near Momand village upon a Nangahar's Achin District village in eastern Afghanistan to destroy tunnel complexes used by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP or ISIS-K). The Guardian reported that following the strike, US and Afghan forces conducted clearing operations and airstrikes in the area and assessed the damage.", "On 26 April, a fight occurred after IS captured 3 drug dealers who were involved in selling opium for the Taliban in Jowzjan Province. An Afghan National Police spokesman stated that the Taliban attacked IS in response, saying \"The clashes erupted when group of armed Taliban attacked Daesh militants [to secure] the release of 3 drug smugglers who came here to pay 10 million afghanis [$14,780] to the Taliban for a deal.\" The Taliban's spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid had also confirmed clashes were ongoing with IS at the time, without providing details on the nature of the fight or reasons. Mohammad Reza Ghafori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said that the clashes between Taliban and IS-K had left 76 Taliban and 15 IS militants dead. IS militants also seized 2 districts from the Taliban, according to the spokesman.", "On 24 May, a clash between the Taliban and IS occurred, and at that time, it had reportedly been the largest clash between the two with 22 casualties, 13 of which were IS fighters, and 9 Taliban fighters, according to a Taliban official. The clashes occurred near Iran's border with Afghanistan. The Taliban had attacked an IS camp in the area, an IS commander, who was formerly a Taliban member, said that there was an agreement between the Taliban and IS not to attack each other until there was a dialogue. The commander claimed that the Taliban had violated the agreement and attacked the IS camp. The IS commander also claimed the attack was coordinated with the Iranian military, and that there were Iranians filming dead IS fighters. The Taliban splinter faction Fidai Mahaz has also criticized the Taliban for its relationship with Iran. Days before the battle, the Taliban reportedly met with Iranian officials to discuss regional issues. A spokesman for Fidai Mahaz claimed the meeting was held at the request of the Taliban, as it was weary of the expansion of IS in the country, which also concerned the Iranian government. The spokesman also said that the Taliban received US$3 million in cash, 3,000 arms, 40 trucks, and the ammunition from Iran's intelligence services, in order to fight IS near the Iranian border, although a Taliban spokesman denied the allegations.", "On 27 November, Taliban executed one of its senior commanders for colluding with IS. A week before, IS fighters were mass executed by their fellow militants in Achin district, according to a provincial government spokesman. However, the spokesman did not provide any additional detail, and neither did IS release any official statement on killing its own members.2018On 20 June, after the talks between the Russian government and the Taliban, US assistant secretary of state Alice Wells condemned the Russian government's position on the Taliban that included backing for the group against IS, stating it gave the Taliban legitimacy and challenged the recognized Afghan government.", "In July, the Taliban launched an offensive against IS in the Jowzjan province.  According to a surrendered IS commander, the Taliban had amassed 2,000 fighters for the offensive against IS. The fighters from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, who had sworn allegiance to IS, were also present fighting alongside IS against the Taliban. During the fighting, 3,500 to 7,000 civilians were displaced. By the end of July, IS's hold in the region was reduced to 2 villages, all thanks to the Taliban's campaign. In response, they requested support from the Afghan government, and also agreed to put down their arms in exchange for protection from the Taliban. The Afghan Air Force later carried out airstrikes against the Taliban in exchange for IS's surrender in the region. The agreement between the Afghan government and IS created controversy afterwards. On 17 July, IS militants killed 15 Taliban militants and injured 5 others during a raid on a house belonging to a Taliban commander in Sar-e Pol. Abdul Qayuom Baqizoi, the police chief of Sar-e Pol, told Associated Press that Taliban and IS fighters have been fighting each other in Jowzjan and Sar-e Pol for more than two months, killing hundreds on both sides.In August, during the negotiations between the US government and the Taliban in Doha, the Taliban had requested that the US ends airstrikes on the Taliban, as well as provide support to the group in order to fight IS.", "2019On 22 June, clashes were reported in Kunar between the Taliban and IS, by an Afghan government official. The official also claimed that the Afghan military had killed some IS fighters in the area, and that the Taliban was active in the area as well.On 29 June, IS released photos of weapons captured from the Taliban. On the same day, IS published a video of its fighters renewing their Bayah to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In the video, fighters criticized the Taliban for engaging in peace talks and called upon Taliban fighters to join IS.On 1 August, the Amaq News Agency claimed that IS had killed 5 Taliban members during clashes in Kunar.On 1 October, IS claimed to have killed and wounded 20 Taliban fighters in Tora Bora.2020 In March 2020, the Afghan Salafist Council under its emir, Shaikh Abdul Aziz Nooristani, met with Taliban leaders and plegded loyalty to their movement. Salafists had previously provided crucial support to IS-K, but recognized that the latter's position had greatly declined after its defeats in Nangarhar and Kunar. The Salafist Council, represented by 32 scholars and military leaders, stated that they were in no way loyal to IS-K, and wanted to be left out of the Islamic State\u2013Taliban conflict. The Taliban leadership accepted the pledge of loyalty, exploiting it in its propaganda.", "In October 2020, former Politico reporter Wesley Morgan revealed that United States special operations forces, longtime foes of the Taliban, had been conducting drone strikes against IS-K to give the Taliban an advantage in the field. According to Morgan, the operators were jokingly referred to as the \"Taliban Air Force\" and instead of communicating directly with Taliban commanders, they would monitor Taliban communications and decide when was the best time to strike. On 10 December 2020, General Kenneth McKenzie Jr., head of U.S. Central Command, confirmed that the U.S. had assisted the Taliban via opportunistic drone strikes, saying that they did not coordinate operations with the Taliban, but took advantage of them fighting a \"common enemy\" to conduct their own operations. Gen. McKenzie said the strikes occurred several months prior when IS-K was holding ground in Nangarhar Province and elsewhere in eastern Afghanistan.After the Taliban's takeover of AfghanistanRenewed Islamic State attacks and anti-Salafist purge", "The Taliban finally succeeded in taking over Afghanistan from the Islamic Republic during a large-scale offensive in summer 2021. Kabul fell on 15 August 2021, prompting the leaders of the IS-K to denounce the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The Taliban immediately moved to contain or purge potential opponents, including Islamic State supporters and Salafists. Across the country, the Taliban ordered the closure of Salaffist mosques seminaries and tried to arrest prominent Salafist scholars, prompting many to go into hiding. Among those targeted by the new Taliban authorities were Salafi clerics who had publicly opposed IS-K. Researcher Abdul Sayed argued that the purge was probably organized by hardline anti-Salafist elements within the Taliban and more motivated by long-time resentment than fears about Salafi support for a future IS-K insurgency. On 16 August, the Taliban claimed to have killed around 150 IS-K fighters, including its former chief Abu Umar Khurasani, while prisoners were being released from a jail in Kabul. However, many IS-K militants were able to rejoin the IS-K ranks because of spree of prison breaks across the country organized by the Taliban.", "On 26 August, a suicide bombing and a mass shooting occurred near Abbey Gate at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan. The attack began hours after the United States' State Department told Americans outside the airport to leave due to a terrorist threat. At least 185 people were killed in the attacks, including 13 U.S. service members. The Taliban condemned the attack, saying \"evil circles will be strictly stopped\". The Taliban later announced that they would take every possible measure to capture IS-KP leader Shahab al-Muhajir. The same day, Saifullah Mohammed, Taliban's CID chief, told The Times that they had captured 6 militants belonging to IS-K following a gun battle in western side of Kabul.", "Taliban militants kidnapped the influential Salafi cleric, Mullah Abu Obaidullah Mutawakil on 28 August; he was \"brutal[ly]\" murdered one week later. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid denied the Taliban's role in the killing of Mutawakil, but also did not condemn the murder. Even though Mutawakil was described as an IS-K sympathiser and a large number of his students were part of IS-K, he had not officially backed the Islamic State. IS-K did not offer prayers for him after his demise, stating that he had not been loyal to the Islamic State's caliphate. On 9 November 2021, Reuters journalist James MacKenzie stated that \"frequent, smaller atrocities\" in the conflict are \"less commonly reported.\" Aside from the ISIS stronghold of Nangarhar, other affected areas include Ghazni in central Afghanistan, Herat in the west, Balkh in the north, and Paktia, Paktika and Khost in the southeast.Islamic State insurgency On 6 September, Neda Mohammad, a Taliban governor for Nangarhar province, vowed to continue fighting IS-K militants. Nangarhar province is a stronghold of IS-K and the governor says that since taking over Nangarhar, his forces had arrested 70\u201380 suspected militants belonging to IS-K in Nangarhar province.On 8 September, Taliban killed Farooq Bengalzai, an ISKP head for a Pakistan's province, in Nimroz, Afghanistan.On 18 September, 7 people were killed when 4 bombs planted by suspected IS-KP members exploded in Jalalabad targeting Taliban patrols.", "On 22 September, 2 Taliban fighters and a civilian were killed by ISIL gunmen who attacked a checkpoint in Ghawchak district of Jalalabad, security sources and witnesses said.On 1 October, Taliban forces raided an ISKP base in the city of Charikar, north of Kabul. The Taliban claimed they had killed and arrested a number of ISKP members.On 2 October, suspected ISKP militants shot dead 2 Taliban fighters and 2 civilians in Jalalabad.On 3 October, an explosion at the entrance to the Eidgah Mosque in Kabul leaves at least 5 dead, where a memorial service was held for the mother of Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. ISKP later claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming it killed Taliban militants.On 4 October, the Taliban says it has \"destroyed an IS\u2013K cell\" in Kabul following yesterday's bombing at a mosque during the memorial for the mother of Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Mujahid says that a special Taliban unit carried out the operation and that the base was destroyed and everyone inside was killed.On 6 October, 7 people, including at least 1 Taliban fighter, were killed in a grenade attack on a religious school in Khost. ISKP claimed responsibility for the attack.On 7 October, the Taliban announced that they had arrested 4 ISKP members after a raid in Paghman district, west of Kabul. On the same day, ISIS claimed responsibility for the capture and execution of a Taliban fighter in District 2 of Jalalabad.", "On 8 October, a Uyghur Islamic State militant, by the name of Muhammad al-Uyghuri killed 55\u2013100 people and injured dozens more after launching a suicide bombing on a Shi'ite mosque in Kunduz.On 9 October, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen announced that there would be no co-operation with the U.S to combat ISKP, saying that the Taliban are 'able to deal with ISIS independently'.On 10 October, ISKP claimed responsibility for the assassination of 2 Taliban fighters in District 7 of Jalalabad.On 14 October, a bomb killed a Taliban police chief in Asadabad, capital of Kunar province, Afghanistan. They also claim that 11 people were injured, including 4 Taliban soldiers.On 15 October, a bomb explosion occurred in Kandahar at the Shia 'Imam Bargah mosque', killing at least 65 people and wounding at least 70 more. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack.On 20 October, the Taliban announced they had arrested at least 250 ISKP operatives between mid-September and mid-October 2021.On 23 October, ISKP claimed responsibility for shooting 2 Taliban fighters dead in District 1 of Jalalabad city.On 24 October, a bomb attack in Afghanistan has left at least 2 civilians dead on Saturday, 1 being a child, and four wounded. The device placed on the road in eastern Afghanistan was aimed at a Taliban vehicle. On the same day, it was reported that ISKP had raised a flag in a village in Uruzgan Province and that the militants were distributing leaflets at mosques in nearby villages.", "On 25 October, 17 people were killed in clashes between gunmen and Taliban forces in Herat. On the same day it was announced that Tajikistan and China had reached an agreement for China to fund construction for a new Tajik military base and that Chinese forces can completely operate a military base near the Afghan border.On 31 October, at least a hundred IS militants reportedly surrendered to the Taliban security forces in Nangarhar province, as part of an operation to suppress the insurgent formation in the country.In the month of October, a former Afghan national army officer, who recently joined ISKP ranks, was killed in clash with Taliban fighters. The former officer commanded the Afghan military's weapons and ammunition depot in Gardez before the Taliban takeover.", "Since the Taliban takeover, the violence in Nangahar province has escalated with near-daily attacks claimed by the Islamic State. The Taliban responded by deploying an additional 1,300 fighters in the province in the month of October with the aim to increase the number of operations conducted against the ISKP fighters in the province. Talibans have also carried out night raids against suspected ISKP fighters in the province and many of the hundreds arrested during those raids have either disappeared or turned up dead. The Taliban's harsh crackdown in the province against the suspected ISKP fighters has resulted in a number of human right violations by the Taliban fighters, according to Nangahar residents. Islamic State has also used Taliban's harsh crackdown as a part of its recruitment propaganda calling on Nangahar residents to rise up and resist the Taliban. Nangahar residents say that the Taliban fighters in the province are not familiar with the area and have no way to check the intelligence they receive about Islamic State targets. So the Taliban fighters have started killing anyone they suspect of working for the Islamic State, according to the residents. Washington Post reports that only a few Taliban fighters have the necessary training or experience to conduct precision-based operations in urban areas. As the Taliban are more adopted to guerrilla warfare, they are therefore still adjusting to maintain security during peacetime.", "By early November, IS-KP in Nangahar was repeatedly assassinating ex-republicans and pro-Taliban figures and attacked patrols with such a frequency that the Taliban government ordered its fighters in the province to no longer leave settlements at night.On 2 November, the 2021 Kabul hospital attack took place where assailants attacked the Daoud Khan Military Hospital with guns and suicide bombers killing at least 25 people and wounding at least 50 more people. A senior Taliban commander, Mawlawi Hamdullah Mukhlis, was killed in the attack. He was the head of the Kabul military corps and was 1 of the first \"senior\" Taliban commanders to enter the abandoned Afghan presidential palace on August 15. The Taliban blamed ISKP for the attack and claimed that they killed at least 4 militants in a shootout. On the same day, ISIL claimed responsibility for killing a Taliban judge in a gun attack in PD-2, Jalalabad.On 7 November, at least 3 members of the Taliban security forces were killed and 3 others wounded in a series of attacks in Jalalabad. \"Two blasts hit the Taliban, then the ISKP militants engaged in a gunfight and finally managed to escape\".On 10 November, a spokesman for the General Directorate of Intelligence, the new name of the Afghan spy agency under Taliban rule, told reporters in Kabul that they have arrested nearly 600 members of ISKP including \u201chigh-ranking\u201d commanders.", "On 13 November, at least 3 people were killed including Afghan journalist Hameed Saighani after a bus exploded in a majority Shia part of Kabul city.

Making this ISKP's first claim of responsibility in Takhar Province since the Taliban takeover.On 9 December, during an interview, the spokesman for the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, Zabiullah Mujahid, claimed that since the re-foundation of the Islamic Emirate, 25 ISKP hideouts had been destroyed and that 670 ISKP fighters had been arrested. He also stated that \u201cDaesh is no longer a big threat in Afghanistan. It was a small group that has now been dismantled in Kabul and Jalalabad.\u201dOn 14 December, Nada Al-Nashif, the UN deputy high commissioner for human rights, announced that the Taliban had been responsible for at least 50 executions of suspected ISKP members, including hangings and beheadings.

{"put": "id:en:doc::doc-en-6467", "fields": {"id": "doc-en-6467", "text": ["The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of frequencies (the spectrum) of electromagnetic radiation and their respective wavelengths and photon energies.The electromagnetic spectrum covers electromagnetic waves with frequencies ranging from below one hertz to above 1025 hertz, corresponding to wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus.  This frequency range is divided into separate bands, and the electromagnetic waves within each frequency band are called by different names; beginning at the low frequency (long wavelength) end of the spectrum these are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays at the high-frequency (short wavelength) end.  The electromagnetic waves in each of these bands have different characteristics, such as how they are produced, how they interact with matter, and their practical applications.  There is no known limit for long wavelengths, while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length. Extreme ultraviolet, soft X-rays, hard X-rays and gamma rays are  classified as ionizing radiation as their photons have enough energy to ionize atoms, causing chemical reactions. Exposure to these rays can be a health hazard, causing radiation sickness, DNA damage and cancer.  Radiation of visible light wavelengths and lower are called nonionizing radiation as they cannot cause these effects.", "In most of the frequency bands above, a technique called spectroscopy can be used to physically separate waves of different frequencies, producing a spectrum showing the constituent frequencies.  Spectroscopy is used to study the interactions of electromagnetic waves with matter.  Other technological uses are described under electromagnetic radiation.History and discovery", "Humans have always been aware of visible light and radiant heat but for most of history it was not known that these phenomena were connected or were representatives of a more extensive principle. The ancient Greeks recognized that light traveled in straight lines and studied some of its properties, including reflection and refraction. Light was intensively studied from the beginning of the 17th century leading to the invention of important instruments like the telescope and microscope.  Isaac Newton was the first to use the term spectrum for the range of colours that white light could be split into with a prism.  Starting in 1666, Newton showed that these colours were intrinsic to light and could be recombined into white light.  A debate arose over whether light had a wave nature or a particle nature with Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens favouring a wave description and Newton favouring a particle description.  Huygens in particular had a well developed theory from which he was able to derive the laws of reflection and refraction.  Around 1801, Thomas Young measured the wavelength of a light beam with his two-slit experiment thus conclusively demonstrating that light was a wave.", "In 1800, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation.  He was studying the temperature of different colours by moving a thermometer through light split by a prism. He noticed that the highest temperature was beyond red. He theorized that this temperature change was due to \"calorific rays\", a type of light ray that could not be seen.  The next year, Johann Ritter, working at the other end of the spectrum, noticed what he called \"chemical rays\" (invisible light rays that induced certain chemical reactions). These behaved similarly to visible violet light rays, but were beyond them in the spectrum.  They were later renamed ultraviolet radiation.", "The study of electromagnetism began in 1820 when Hans Christian \u00d8rsted discovered that electric currents produce magnetic fields (Oersted's law). Light was first linked to electromagnetism in 1845, when Michael Faraday noticed that the polarization of light traveling through a transparent material responded to a magnetic field (see Faraday effect). During the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell developed four partial differential equations (Maxwell's equations) for the electromagnetic field. Two of these equations predicted the possibility and behavior of waves in the field. Analyzing the speed of these theoretical waves, Maxwell realized that they must travel at a speed that was about the known speed of light. This startling coincidence in value led Maxwell to make the inference that light itself is a type of electromagnetic wave. Maxwell's equations predicted an infinite range of frequencies of electromagnetic waves, all traveling at the speed of light. This was the first indication of the existence of the entire electromagnetic spectrum.", "Maxwell's predicted waves included waves at very low frequencies compared to infrared, which in theory might be created by oscillating charges in an ordinary electrical circuit of a certain type. Attempting to prove Maxwell's equations and detect such low frequency electromagnetic radiation, in 1886, the physicist Heinrich Hertz built an apparatus to generate and detect what are now called radio waves. Hertz found the waves and was able to infer (by measuring their wavelength and multiplying it by their frequency) that they traveled at the speed of light. Hertz also demonstrated that the new radiation could be both reflected and refracted by various dielectric media, in the same manner as light. For example, Hertz was able to focus the waves using a lens made of tree resin. In a later experiment, Hertz similarly produced and measured the properties of microwaves. These new types of waves paved the way for inventions such as the wireless telegraph and the radio.In 1895, Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen noticed a new type of radiation emitted during an experiment with an evacuated tube subjected to a high voltage. He called this radiation \"x-rays\" and found that they were able to travel through parts of the human body but were reflected or stopped by denser matter such as bones. Before long, many uses were found for this radiography.", "The last portion of the electromagnetic spectrum was filled in with the discovery of gamma rays. In 1900, Paul Villard was studying the radioactive emissions of radium when he identified a new type of radiation that he at first thought consisted of particles similar to known alpha and beta particles, but with the power of being far more penetrating than either. However, in 1910, British physicist William Henry Bragg demonstrated that gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, not particles, and in 1914, Ernest Rutherford (who had named them gamma rays in 1903 when he realized that they were fundamentally different from charged alpha and beta particles) and Edward Andrade measured their wavelengths, and found that gamma rays were similar to X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths.The wave-particle debate was rekindled in 1901 when Max Planck discovered that light is only absorbed in discrete \"quanta\", now called photons, implying that light has a particle nature.  This idea was made explicit by Albert Einstein in 1905, but never accepted by Planck and many other contemporaries.  The modern position of science is that electromagnetic radiation has both a wave and a particle nature, the wave-particle duality. The contradictions arising from this position are still being debated by scientists and philosophers.", "RangeElectromagnetic waves are typically described by any of the following three physical properties: the frequency f, wavelength \u03bb, or photon energy E. Frequencies observed in astronomy range from  (1 GeV gamma rays) down to the local plasma frequency of the ionized interstellar medium (~1\u00a0kHz). Wavelength is inversely proportional to the wave frequency, so gamma rays have very short wavelengths that are fractions of the size of atoms, whereas wavelengths on the opposite end of the spectrum can be indefinitely long. Photon energy is directly proportional to the wave frequency, so gamma ray photons have the highest energy (around a billion electron volts), while radio wave photons have very low energy (around a femtoelectronvolt). These relations are illustrated by the following equations:where: c =  is the speed of light in a vacuum h =  =  is Planck's constant.Whenever electromagnetic waves exist in a medium with matter, their wavelength is decreased. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, whatever medium they are traveling through, are usually quoted in terms of the vacuum wavelength, although this is not always explicitly stated.Generally, electromagnetic radiation is classified by wavelength into radio wave, microwave, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. The behavior of EM radiation depends on its wavelength. When EM radiation interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior also depends on the amount of energy per quantum (photon) it carries.", "Spectroscopy can detect a much wider region of the EM spectrum than the visible wavelength range of 400\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm in a vacuum. A common laboratory spectroscope can detect wavelengths from 2\u00a0nm to 2500\u00a0nm. Detailed information about the physical properties of objects, gases, or even stars can be obtained from this type of device. Spectroscopes are widely used in astrophysics. For example, many hydrogen atoms emit a radio wave photon that has a wavelength of 21.12\u00a0cm. Also, frequencies of 30 Hz and below can be produced by and are important in the study of certain stellar nebulae and frequencies as high as  have been detected from astrophysical sources.RegionsThe types of electromagnetic radiation are broadly classified into the following classes (regions, bands or types): Gamma radiation X-ray radiation Ultraviolet radiation Visible light Infrared radiation Microwave radiation Radio wavesThis classification goes in the increasing order of wavelength, which is characteristic of the type of radiation.", "There are no precisely defined boundaries between the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum; rather they fade into each other like the bands in a rainbow (which is the sub-spectrum of visible light). Radiation of each frequency and wavelength (or in each band) has a mix of properties of the two regions of the spectrum that bound it. For example, red light resembles infrared radiation in that it can excite and add energy to some chemical bonds and indeed must do so to power the chemical mechanisms responsible for photosynthesis and the working of the visual system.The distinction between X-rays and gamma rays is partly based on sources: the photons generated from nuclear decay or other nuclear and subnuclear/particle process are always termed gamma rays, whereas X-rays are generated by electronic transitions involving highly energetic inner atomic electrons. In general, nuclear transitions are much more energetic than electronic transitions, so gamma rays are more energetic than X-rays, but exceptions exist. By analogy to electronic transitions, muonic atom transitions are also said to produce X-rays, even though their energy may exceed , whereas there are many (77 known to be less than ) low-energy nuclear transitions (e.g., the  nuclear transition of thorium-229m), and, despite being one million-fold less energetic than some muonic X-rays, the emitted photons are still called gamma rays due to their nuclear origin.", "The convention that EM radiation that is known to come from the nucleus is always called \"gamma ray\" radiation is the only convention that is universally respected, however. Many astronomical gamma ray sources (such as gamma ray bursts) are known to be too energetic (in both intensity and wavelength) to be of nuclear origin. Quite often, in high-energy physics and in medical radiotherapy, very high energy EMR (in the >\u00a010\u00a0MeV region)\u2014which is of higher energy than any nuclear gamma ray\u2014is not called X-ray or gamma ray, but instead by the generic term of \"high-energy photons\".The region of the spectrum where a particular observed electromagnetic radiation falls is reference frame-dependent (due to the Doppler shift for light), so EM radiation that one observer would say is in one region of the spectrum could appear to an observer moving at a substantial fraction of the speed of light with respect to the first to be in another part of the spectrum. For example, consider the cosmic microwave background. It was produced when matter and radiation decoupled, by the de-excitation of hydrogen atoms to the ground state. These photons were from Lyman series transitions, putting them in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Now this radiation has undergone enough cosmological red shift to put it into the microwave region of the spectrum for observers moving slowly (compared to the speed of light) with respect to the cosmos.", "Rationale for namesElectromagnetic radiation interacts with matter in different ways across the spectrum. These types of interaction are so different that historically different names have been applied to different parts of the spectrum, as though these were different types of radiation. Thus, although these \"different kinds\" of electromagnetic radiation form a quantitatively continuous spectrum of frequencies and wavelengths, the spectrum remains divided for practical reasons related to these qualitative interaction differences.Types of radiationRadio wavesRadio waves are emitted and received by antennas, which consist of conductors such as metal rod resonators.  In artificial generation of radio waves, an electronic device called a transmitter generates an AC electric current which is applied to an antenna.  The oscillating electrons in the antenna generate oscillating electric and magnetic fields that radiate away from the antenna as radio waves.  In reception of radio waves, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of a radio wave couple to the electrons in an antenna, pushing them back and forth, creating oscillating currents which are applied to a radio receiver.  Earth's atmosphere is mainly transparent to radio waves, except for layers of charged particles in the ionosphere which can reflect certain frequencies.", "Radio waves are extremely widely used to transmit information across distances in radio communication systems such as radio broadcasting, television, two way radios,  mobile phones, communication satellites, and wireless networking.  In a radio communication system, a radio frequency current is modulated with an information-bearing signal in a transmitter by varying either the amplitude, frequency or phase, and applied to an antenna.  The radio waves carry the information across space to a receiver, where they are received by an antenna and the information extracted by demodulation in the receiver.     Radio waves are also used for navigation in systems like Global Positioning System (GPS) and navigational beacons, and locating distant objects in radiolocation and radar.  They are also used for remote control, and for industrial heating.The use of the radio spectrum is strictly regulated by governments, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) which allocates frequencies to different users for different uses.Microwaves", "Microwaves are radio waves of short wavelength, from about 10 centimeters to one millimeter, in the SHF and EHF frequency bands.   Microwave energy is produced with klystron and magnetron tubes, and with solid state devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes.  Although they are emitted and absorbed by short antennas, they are also absorbed by polar molecules, coupling to vibrational and rotational modes, resulting in bulk heating.  Unlike higher frequency waves such as infrared and light which are absorbed mainly at surfaces, microwaves can penetrate into materials and deposit their energy below the surface.   This effect is used to heat food in microwave ovens, and for industrial heating and medical diathermy.    Microwaves are the main wavelengths used in radar, and are used for satellite communication, and wireless networking technologies such as Wi-Fi. The copper cables (transmission lines) which are used to carry lower frequency radio waves to antennas have excessive power losses at microwave frequencies, and metal pipes called waveguides are used to carry them.  Although at the low end of the band the atmosphere is mainly transparent, at the upper end of the band absorption of microwaves by atmospheric gasses limits practical propagation distances to a few kilometers.", "Terahertz radiation or sub-millimeter radiation is a region of the spectrum from about 100\u00a0GHz to 30 terahertz (THz) between microwaves and far infrared which can be regarded as belonging to either band. Until recently, the range was rarely studied and few sources existed for microwave energy in the so-called terahertz gap, but applications such as imaging and communications are now appearing. Scientists are also looking to apply terahertz technology in the armed forces, where high-frequency waves might be directed at enemy troops to incapacitate their electronic equipment.  Terahertz radiation is strongly absorbed by atmospheric gases, making this frequency range useless for long-distance communication.Infrared radiation", "The infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum covers the range from roughly 300\u00a0GHz to 400 THz (1\u00a0mm \u2013 750\u00a0nm). It can be divided into three parts: Far-infrared, from 300\u00a0GHz to 30 THz (1\u00a0mm \u2013 10 \u03bcm). The lower part of this range may also be called microwaves or terahertz waves. This radiation is typically absorbed by so-called rotational modes in gas-phase molecules, by molecular motions in liquids, and by phonons in solids. The water in Earth's atmosphere absorbs so strongly in this range that it renders the atmosphere in effect opaque. However, there are certain wavelength ranges (\"windows\") within the opaque range that allow partial transmission, and can be used for astronomy. The wavelength range from approximately 200 \u03bcm up to a few mm is often referred to as Submillimetre astronomy, reserving far infrared for wavelengths below 200 \u03bcm. Mid-infrared, from 30 to 120 THz (10\u20132.5 \u03bcm). Hot objects (black-body radiators) can radiate strongly in this range, and human skin at normal body temperature radiates strongly at the lower end of this region. This radiation is absorbed by molecular vibrations, where the different atoms in a molecule vibrate around their equilibrium positions. This range is sometimes called the fingerprint region, since the mid-infrared absorption spectrum of a compound is very specific for that compound.", "Near-infrared, from 120 to 400 THz (2,500\u2013750\u00a0nm). Physical processes that are relevant for this range are similar to those for visible light. The highest frequencies in this region can be detected directly by some types of photographic film, and by many types of solid state image sensors for infrared photography and videography.", "Visible lightAbove infrared in frequency comes visible light. The Sun emits its peak power in the visible region, although integrating the entire emission power spectrum through all wavelengths shows that the Sun emits slightly more infrared than visible light. By definition, visible light is the part of the EM spectrum the human eye is the most sensitive to. Visible light (and near-infrared light) is typically absorbed and emitted by electrons in molecules and atoms that move from one energy level to another. This action allows the chemical mechanisms that underlie human vision and plant photosynthesis. The light that excites the human visual system is a very small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. A rainbow shows the optical (visible) part of the electromagnetic spectrum; infrared (if it could be seen) would be located just beyond the red side of the rainbow whilst ultraviolet would appear just beyond the opposite violet end.", "Electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 380 nm and 760\u00a0nm (400\u2013790 terahertz) is detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Other wavelengths, especially near infrared (longer than 760\u00a0nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 380\u00a0nm) are also sometimes referred to as light, especially when the visibility to humans is not relevant. White light is a combination of lights of different wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Passing white light through a prism splits it up into the several colours of light observed in the visible spectrum between 400\u00a0nm and 780\u00a0nm.If radiation having a frequency in the visible region of the EM spectrum reflects off an object, say, a bowl of fruit, and then strikes the eyes, this results in visual perception of the scene. The brain's visual system processes the multitude of reflected frequencies into different shades and hues, and through this insufficiently-understood psychophysical phenomenon, most people perceive a bowl of fruit.At most wavelengths, however, the information carried by electromagnetic radiation is not directly detected by human senses. Natural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum, and technology can also manipulate a broad range of wavelengths. Optical fiber transmits light that, although not necessarily in the visible part of the spectrum (it is usually infrared), can carry information. The modulation is similar to that used with radio waves.Ultraviolet radiation", "Next in frequency comes ultraviolet (UV). The wavelength of UV rays is shorter than the violet end of the visible spectrum but longer than the X-ray.UV is the longest wavelength radiation whose photons are energetic enough to ionize atoms, separating electrons from them, and thus causing chemical reactions.  Short wavelength UV and the shorter wavelength radiation above it (X-rays and gamma rays) are called ionizing radiation, and exposure to them can damage living tissue, making them a health hazard.  UV can also cause many substances to glow with visible light; this is called fluorescence.At the middle range of UV, UV rays cannot ionize but can break chemical bonds, making molecules unusually reactive. Sunburn, for example, is caused by the disruptive effects of middle range UV radiation on skin cells, which is the main cause of skin cancer. UV rays in the middle range can irreparably damage the complex DNA molecules in the cells producing thymine dimers making it a very potent mutagen.", "The Sun emits significant UV radiation (about 10% of its total power), including extremely short wavelength UV that could potentially destroy most life on land (ocean water would provide some protection for life there). However, most of the Sun's damaging UV wavelengths are absorbed by the atmosphere before they reach the surface. The higher energy (shortest wavelength) ranges of UV (called \"vacuum UV\") are absorbed by nitrogen and, at longer wavelengths, by simple diatomic oxygen in the air. Most of the UV in the mid-range of energy is blocked by the ozone layer, which absorbs strongly in the important 200\u2013315\u00a0nm range, the lower energy part of which is too long for ordinary dioxygen in air to absorb. This leaves less than 3% of sunlight at sea level in UV, with all of this remainder at the lower energies. The remainder is UV-A, along with some UV-B. The very lowest energy range of UV between 315\u00a0nm and visible light (called UV-A) is not blocked well by the atmosphere, but does not cause sunburn and does less biological damage. However, it is not harmless and does create oxygen radicals, mutations and skin damage.X-rays", "After UV come X-rays, which, like the upper ranges of UV are also ionizing. However, due to their higher energies, X-rays can also interact with matter by means of the Compton effect. Hard X-rays have shorter wavelengths than soft X-rays and as they can pass through many substances with little absorption, they can be used to 'see through' objects with 'thicknesses' less than that equivalent to a few meters of water. One notable use is diagnostic X-ray imaging in medicine (a process known as radiography). X-rays are useful as probes in high-energy physics. In astronomy, the accretion disks around neutron stars and black holes emit X-rays, enabling studies of these phenomena. X-rays are also emitted by stellar corona and are strongly emitted by some types of nebulae. However, X-ray telescopes must be placed outside the Earth's atmosphere to see astronomical X-rays, since the great depth of the atmosphere of Earth is opaque to X-rays (with areal density of 1000 g/cm2), equivalent to 10 meters thickness of water. This is an amount sufficient to block almost all astronomical X-rays (and also astronomical gamma rays\u2014see below).Gamma rays", "After hard X-rays come gamma rays, which were discovered by Paul Ulrich Villard in 1900. These are the most energetic photons, having no defined lower limit to their wavelength. In astronomy they are valuable for studying high-energy objects or regions, however as with X-rays this can only be done with telescopes outside the Earth's atmosphere. Gamma rays are used experimentally by physicists for their penetrating ability and are produced by a number of  radioisotopes. They are used for irradiation of foods and seeds for sterilization, and in medicine they are occasionally used in radiation cancer therapy. More commonly, gamma rays are used for diagnostic imaging in nuclear medicine, an example being PET scans. The wavelength of gamma rays can be measured with high accuracy through the effects of Compton scattering.See also Bandplan Cosmic ray Digital dividend after digital television transition Electroencephalography Infrared window Ionizing radiation List of international common standards Optical window Ozone layer Radiant energy Radiation Radio window Spectroscopy V band W bandNotes and referencesExternal links", "Australian Radiofrequency Spectrum Allocations Chart (from Australian Communications and Media Authority) Canadian Table of Frequency Allocations  (from Industry Canada) U.S. Frequency Allocation Chart \u2013 Covering the range 3\u00a0kHz to 300\u00a0GHz (from Department of Commerce) UK frequency allocation table (from Ofcom, which inherited the Radiocommunications Agency's duties, pdf format) Flash EM Spectrum Presentation / Tool \u2013 Very complete and customizable.

The license privileges of amateur radio operators include the use of frequencies within this band for telecommunication, usually conducted locally with a line-of-sight range of about .HistoryAmateur radio The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allows amateur radio operations in the frequency range from 144 to 148\u00a0MHz. subject to variation by country.Operation Because it is local and reliable, and because the licensing requirements to transmit on the 2-meter band are easy to meet in many parts of the world, this band is one of the most popular non-HF ham bands. This popularity, the compact size of needed radios and antennas, and this band's ability to provide easy reliable local communications also means that it is also the most used band for local emergency communications efforts, such as providing communications between Red Cross shelters and local authorities. In the US, that role in emergency communications is furthered by the fact that most amateur-radio operators have a 2-meter handheld transceiver (HT), handie-talkie, or walkie-talkie.", "Repeaters and FM Much of 2-meter FM operation uses a radio repeater, a radio receiver and transmitter that instantly retransmits a received signal on a separate frequency.  Repeaters are normally located in high locations such as a tall building or a hill top overlooking expanses of territory.  On VHF frequencies such as 2-meters, antenna height greatly influences how far one can talk.  Typical reliable repeater range is about .  Some repeaters in unusually high locations, such as skyscrapers or mountain tops, can be usable as far out as .  Reliable range is very dependent on the height of the repeater antenna and also on the height and surroundings of the handheld or mobile unit attempting to access to the repeater.  Line of sight would be the ultimate in reliability. The typical hand held two meter FM transceiver produces about 5 watts of transmit power. Stations in a car or home might provide higher power, 25 to 75 watts, and may use a simple vertical antenna mounted on a pole or on the rooftop of a house or a vehicle.", "Even without repeaters available, however, the 2-meter band provides reliable crosstown communications throughout smaller towns, making it ideal for emergency communications.  Antennas for repeater work are almost always vertically polarized since 2-meter antennas on cars are usually vertically polarized. Matching polarization allows for maximum signal coupling which equates to stronger signals in both directions. Simple radios for FM repeater operation have become plentiful and inexpensive in recent years.Communications beyond 50\u00a0miles While the 2\u00a0meter band is best known as a local band using the FM mode, there are many opportunities for long distance (DX) communications using other modes. A well-placed antenna and high-power equipment can achieve distances of up to a few hundred miles, and fortuitous propagation conditions called \"signal enhancements\" can on occasion reach across oceans.The typical 2\u00a0meter station using CW (Morse code) or SSB (single side band) modes consists of a radio driving a power amplifier generating about 200\u2013500\u00a0Watts of RF power. This extra power is usually fed to a multi-element, compound antenna, usually a Yagi-Uda or Yagi, which can beam most of the signal power towards the intended receiving station. \"Beam antennas\" provide substantial increase in signal directivity over ordinary dipole or vertical antennas. Antennas used for distance work are usually horizontally polarized instead of the vertical polarization customarily used for local contacts.", "Stations that have antennas located in relatively high locations with views (from the antenna) clear to the horizon have a big advantage over other stations. Such stations are able to communicate  consistently. It is usual for them to be heard at distances far beyond line of sight on a daily basis without help from signal enhancements. Signal enhancements are unusual circumstances in the atmosphere and ionosphere that bend the signal path into an arc that better follows the curve of the Earth, instead of the radio waves traveling in the usual straight line off into space. The best known of these are: tropospheric ducting  sporadic\u00a0E meteor scatterThese and other well-known forms of VHF signal enhancement that allow trans-oceanic and trans-continental contacts on 2\u00a0meters are described in the subsections that follow within this section.With the exception of sporadic\u00a0E, directional antennas such as Yagis or log periodic antennas are almost essential to take advantage of signal enhancements. When a well-equipped station with its antenna well-located \u201chigh and in the clear\u201d is operating during a signal enhancement, astonishing distances can be bridged, momentarily approaching what is regularly possible on shortwave and mediumwave.", "Tropospheric ducting Occasionally, signal bending in the atmosphere's troposphere known as tropospheric ducting can allow 2\u00a0meter signals to carry hundreds or even thousands of kilometers as evidenced by the occasional 2\u00a0meter contact between the west coast of the United States and the Hawaiian Islands, the northeast region to the Florida coast, and across the Gulf of Mexico. These so-called \"Openings\" are generally first spotted by amateurs operating SSB (Single Side Band) and CW (Continuous Wave) modes since amateurs using these modes typically are attempting distance contacts (DX) and alert for signal enhancement events.Completion of contacts using these weak signal modes involves the exchange of signal level reports and location by grid square which is known as the Maidenhead Locator System. Two way ducting contacts can have very strong signals and are often made with moderate power, small antennas, and other types of modes. Long distance ducting contacts do occur using FM modes as well but for the most part go unnoticed by many FM operators.Sporadic E Another form of VHF propagation is called Sporadic E propagation. This is a phenomenon whereby radio signals are reflected back towards Earth by highly ionized segments of the ionosphere which can facilitate contacts in excess of  with very strong signals received by both parties.", "Unlike some other long distance modes, high power and large antennas are often not required to make contact with distant stations via a sporadic\u00a0E event. A two-way conversation can take place over a distance of several hundred kilometers or more, often using low levels of RF power. Sporadic\u00a0E is a rare and completely random propagation phenomenon lasting anywhere from a matter of minutes to several hours.Satellite communications Satellites are basically repeater stations in orbit. The 2\u00a0meter band is also used in conjunction with the 70-centimeter band, or the 10-meter band and various microwave bands via orbiting amateur radio satellites. This is known as cross band repeating. On-board software defines what mode or band is in use at any particular time and this is determined by amateurs at so-called earth stations who control or instruct the satellite behavior. Amateurs know what mode is in use via published internet schedules.For instance, a favorite mode is Mode\u00a0\"B\" or \"V/U\" which simply indicates the uplink and downlink frequencies or bands the satellite is currently using. In this example, V/U means VHF/UHF or VHF uplink with UHF downlink. Most amateur satellites are Low Earth Orbit satellites, or LEO's as they are affectionately known, and generally are at about 450\u00a0miles (700\u00a0km) altitude. At that height, amateurs can expect reception distances of up to around .", "A few amateur satellites have very high elliptical orbits. These satellites can reach altitudes of 30,000\u00a0miles (50,000\u00a0km) above the earth where an entire hemisphere is visible providing outstanding communications capabilities from any two points on the earth within line of sight of the satellite; distances that are far beyond the reach of the LEOs.Transequatorial propagation Transequatorial propagation, also known as (TEP), is a regular daytime occurrence on the 2\u00a0meter band over the equatorial regions and is common in the temperate latitudes in late spring, early summer and, to a lesser degree, in early winter. For receiving stations located within \u00b1\u00a010\u00a0degrees of the geomagnetic equator, equatorial E-skip can be expected on most days throughout the year, peaking around midday local time.Meteor burst By speeding up Morse code using analog tape or digital modes such as JT6M or FSK441, very short high-speed bursts of digital data can be bounced off the ionized gas trail of meteor showers. The speed required to confirm a two way contact via a short lived ionized meteor trail can only be performed by fast computers on both ends with very little human interaction.", "One computer will send a request for contact and if successfully received by a distant station, a reply will be sent by the receiving stations computer usually via the same ionized meteor trail to confirm the contact. If nothing is received after the request, a new request is transmitted. This continues until a reply is received to confirm the contact or until no contact can be made and no new requests are sent. Using this high speed digital mode, a full two way contact, can be completed in one second or less and can only be validated using a computer. Depending on the intensity of the ionized meteor trail, multiple contacts from multiple stations can be made off the same trail until it dissipates and can no longer reflect VHF signals with sufficient strength.  This mode is often called burst transmission and can yield communication distances similar to sporadic\u00a0E as described above.Auroral propagation Another phenomenon that produces upper atmosphere ionization suitable for 2-meter DXing are the auroras. Since the ionization persists much longer than meteor trails, voice modulated radio signals may sometimes be used, but the constant movement of the ionized gas leads to heavy distortion of the signals causing the audio to sound \"ghostly\" and whispered. In most instances using auroral reflections on 2\u00a0meters, audio or voice is totally unintelligible and ham operators wishing to make contacts via aurora, must resort to CW (Morse code).", "CW signals returning from an auroral reflection have no distinct sound or tone but simply sound like a swishing or whooshing noise. An exception to this phenomenon would be the 6\u00a0meter band which is significantly lower in frequency than the 2\u00a0meter band by 94\u00a0MHz. In many instances 6\u00a0meter voice modes are readable but with varying degrees of difficulty when reflected off an aurora. Therefore, when using an auroral event as a radio signal reflector, the reflected signal strength and signal intelligibility decreases with increasing transmitting frequency.Moonbounce (EME) To communicate over the longest distances, hams use moon bounce. VHF signals normally escape the Earth's atmosphere, so using the moon as a target is quite practical. Due to the distance involved and the very high path loss getting a readable signal bounced off the moon involves high power ~1,000\u00a0Watts and steerable high gain antennas. Receiving these very weak return signals, again involves the use of high gain antennas (usually the same type used to transmit the signal) and a very low-noise front end RF amplifier and a frequency stable receiver.", "However, new and recent technological advances in weak signal detection has allowed the successful reception of signals off the moon using much smaller or less well equipped stations allowing reception of signals that are \"in the noise\" and not audible to the human ear. One of these modes is JT65 which is a digital mode. Due to the delay of the signal traveling to the moon and back (travel time approx. 2.5\u00a0seconds), a person transmitting may hear the end of their own transmission returning.The Brendan Awards The Irish Radio Transmitters Society has provided a series of awards for the first successful all-natural, non-bounce contacts on 2\u00a0metres between the North American and European continents. Named for Saint Brendan of Clonfert, the three awards differentiate between successful \"traditional\" phone/CW contact (the Brendan Trophies), successful \"non-traditional\" digital two-way contact (the Brendan Shields), and an award for the first verified reception in either direction, regardless of method (the Brendan Plates). Attempts at the Brendan awards have established contact, but further examination revealed the signal was bounced off the International Space Station.", "Los Angeles County statute Los Angeles County has a statute (which dates from 1944) concerning mounting a \"shortwave receiver\" in a motor vehicle.  While the statute specifically states one of the forbidden bands as 150\u2013160\u00a0MHz, most two-meter transceivers can tune into this portion of the spectrum at least as receivers, and are therefore unlawful to mount in a motor vehicle in Los Angeles County.  While arrest rarely happens, the statute is still on the books.  There are also California Penal Code statutes covering similar activities.  Recently, however, with new legislation in various states, licensed ham radio operators are exempt from these prohibitions including exemptions from using a radio while driving. Such prohibitions or exemptions vary from state to state.Note that federal law preempts many local ordinances and state laws that may prohibit a licensed amateur radio operator from possessing an amateur radio based on its factory ability to receive frequencies outside of ham bands.See alsoAmateur radioReferencesExternal links Build a vertical antenna for the 2-meter bandDX-Sherlock's real-time 2m propagation mapsDX-Sherlock's real-time VHF&up propagation tickerAmateur radio bands"]}}
{"put": "id:en:doc::doc-en-649908", "fields": {"id": "doc-en-649908", "text": ["Luteinizing hormone (LH, also known as lutropin and sometimes lutrophin) is a hormone produced by gonadotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland. The production of LH is regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. In females, an acute rise of LH (\"LH surge\") triggers ovulation and development of the corpus luteum. In males, where LH had also been called interstitial cell\u2013stimulating hormone (ICSH), it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone. It acts synergistically with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).Structure LH  is a heterodimeric glycoprotein. Each monomeric unit is a  glycoprotein molecule; one alpha and one beta subunit make the full, functional protein.Its structure is similar to that of the other glycoprotein hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The protein dimer contains 2 glycopeptidic subunits (labeled alpha- and beta- subunits) that are non-covalently associated:", "The alpha subunits of LH, FSH, TSH, and hCG are identical, and contain 92 amino acids in human but 96 amino acids in almost all other vertebrate species (glycoprotein hormones do not exist in invertebrates). The beta subunits vary. LH has a beta subunit of  120 amino acids (LHB) that confers its specific biologic action and is responsible for the specificity of the interaction with the LH receptor. This beta subunit contains an amino acid sequence that exhibits large homologies with that of the beta subunit of hCG and both stimulate the same receptor.  However, the hCG beta subunit contains an additional 24 amino acids, and the two hormones differ in the composition of their sugar moieties.The different composition of these oligosaccharides affects bioactivity and speed of degradation. The biologic half-life of LH is 20 minutes, shorter than that of  FSH (3\u20134 hours) and hCG (24 hours). The biological half-life of LH is 23 hours subcutaneous or terminal half life of 10-12 hours.Genes The gene for the alpha subunit is located on chromosome 6q12.21.The luteinizing hormone beta subunit gene is localized in the LHB/CGB gene cluster on chromosome 19q13.32. In contrast to the alpha gene activity, beta LH subunit gene activity is restricted to the pituitary gonadotropic cells. It is regulated by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the  hypothalamus. Inhibin, activin, and sex hormones do not affect genetic activity  for the beta subunit production of LH.Function", "In both males and females, LH works upon endocrine cells in the gonads to produce androgens.Effects in females", "LH supports theca cells in the ovaries that provide androgens and hormonal precursors for estradiol production. At the time of menstruation, FSH initiates follicular growth, specifically affecting granulosa cells. With the rise in estrogens, LH receptors are also expressed on the maturing follicle, which causes it to produce more estradiol. Eventually, when the follicle has fully matured, a spike in 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone production by the follicle inhibits the production of estrogens, leading to a decrease in estrogen-mediated negative feedback of GnRH in the hypothalamus, which then stimulates the release of LH from the anterior pituitary. However another theory of the LH peak is a positive feedback mechanism from estradiol. The levels keep rising through the follicular phase and when they reach an unknown threshold, this results in the peak of the LH. This effect is opposite from the usual negative feedback mechanism presented at lower levels. In other words, the mechanism(s) are not yet clear.", "The increase in LH production only lasts for 24 to 48 hours. This \"LH surge\" triggers ovulation, thereby not only releasing the egg from the follicle, but also initiating the conversion of the residual follicle into a corpus luteum that, in turn, produces progesterone to prepare the endometrium for a possible implantation. LH is necessary to maintain luteal function for the second two weeks of the menstrual cycle. If pregnancy occurs, LH levels will decrease, and luteal function will instead be maintained by the action of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), a hormone very similar to LH but secreted from the new placenta.", "Gonadal steroids (estrogens and androgens) generally have negative feedback effects on GnRH-1 release at the level of the hypothalamus and at the gonadotropes, reducing their sensitivity to GnRH. Positive feedback by estrogens also occurs in the gonadal axis of female mammals and is responsible for the midcycle surge of LH that stimulates ovulation. Although estrogens inhibit kisspeptin (Kp) release from kiss1 neurons in the ARC, estrogens stimulate Kp release from the Kp neurons in the AVPV. As estrogens' levels gradually increase the positive effect predominates, leading to the LH surge. GABA-secreting neurons that innervate GnRH-1 neurons also can stimulate GnRH-1 release. These GABA neurons also possess ERs and may be responsible for the GnRH-1 surge. Part of the inhibitory action of endorphins on GnRH-1 release is through inhibition of these GABA neurons. Rupture of the ovarian follicle at ovulation causes a drastic reduction in estrogen synthesis and a marked increase in secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum in the ovary, reinstating a predominantly negative feedback on hypothalamic secretion of GnRH-1.", "Effects in males LH acts upon the Leydig cells of the testis and is regulated by  gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The Leydig cells produce testosterone under the control of LH. LH binds to LH receptors on the membrane surface of Leydig cells. Binding to this receptor causes an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a secondary messenger, which allows cholesterol to translocate into the mitochondria. Within the mitochondria, cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone by CYP11A1. Pregnenolone is then converted to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). DHEA is then converted to androstenedione by 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-HSD) and then finally converted to testosterone by 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD17B). The onset of puberty is controlled by two major hormones: FSH initiates spermatogenesis and LH signals the release of testosterone, an androgen that exerts both endocrine activity and intratesticular activity on spermatogenesis.", "LH is released from the pituitary gland, and is controlled by pulses of  gonadotropin-releasing hormone. When bloodstream testosterone levels are low, the pituitary gland is stimulated to release LH. As the levels of testosterone increase, it will act on the pituitary through a negative feedback loop and inhibit the release of GnRH and LH consequently. Androgens (including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the pineal gland, leading to increased melatonin and reduced LH and FSH by melatonin-induced increase of Gonadotropin-Inhibitory Hormone (GnIH) synthesis and secretion. Testosterone can also be aromatized into estradiol (E2) to inhibit LH. E2 decreases pulse amplitude and responsiveness to GnRH from the hypothalamus onto the pituitary.Changes in LH and testosterone blood levels and pulse secretions are induced by changes in sexual arousal in human males.Normal levels LH levels are normally low during childhood and in women, high after menopause. Since LH is secreted as pulses, it is necessary to follow its concentration over a sufficient period of time to get proper information about its blood level.During reproductive years, typical levels are between 1 and 20 IU/L. Physiologic high LH levels are seen during the LH surge (v.s.) and typically last 48 hours.In males over 18 years of age, reference ranges have been estimated to be 1.8\u20138.6 IU/L.", "LH is measured in international units (IU). When quantifying the amount of LH in a sample in IUs, it is important to know which international standard your lot of LH was calibrated against since they can vary broadly from year to year.  For human urinary LH, one IU is most recently defined as 1/189th of an ampule denoted 96/602 and distributed by the NIBSC, corresponding to approximately 0.04656\u00a0\u00b5g of LH protein for a single IU, but older standard versions are still widely in use.Predicting ovulation The detection of a surge in release of luteinizing hormone indicates impending ovulation. LH can be detected by urinary ovulation predictor kits (OPK, also LH-kit) that are performed, typically daily, around the time ovulation may be expected.  A conversion from a negative to a positive reading would suggest that ovulation is about to occur within 24\u201348 hours, giving women two days to engage in sexual intercourse or artificial insemination with the intention of conceiving.", "The recommended testing frequency differs between manufacturers. For example, the Clearblue test is taken daily, and an increased frequency does not decrease the risk of missing an LH surge. On the other hand, the Chinese company Nantong Egens Biotechnology recommends using their test twice per day. If testing once per day, no significant difference has been found between testing LH in the morning versus in the evening, in relation to conception rates, and recommendations of what time in the day to take the test varies between manufacturers and healthcare workers. Tests may be read manually using a color-change paper strip, or digitally with the assistance of reading electronics.Tests for luteinizing hormone may be combined with testing for estradiol in tests such as the Clearblue fertility monitor.The sensitivity of LH tests are measured in milli international unit, with tests commonly available in the range 10\u201340 m.i.u. (the lower the number, the higher the sensitivity).As sperm can stay viable in the woman for several days, LH tests are not recommended for contraceptive practices, as the LH surge typically occurs after the beginning of the fertile window.Disease statesExcess In children with precocious puberty of pituitary or central origin, LH and FSH levels may be in the reproductive range instead of the low levels typical for their age.", "During the reproductive years, relatively elevated LH is frequently seen in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome; however, it would be unusual for them to have LH levels outside of the normal reproductive range.Persistently high LH levels are indicative of situations where the normal restricting feedback from the gonad is absent, leading to a pituitary production of  both LH and FSH. While this is typical in menopause, it is abnormal in the reproductive years. There it may be a sign of: Premature menopause Gonadal dysgenesis, Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome Castration Swyer syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome Certain forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia Testicular failure Pregnancy - BetaHCG can mimic LH so tests may show elevated LHNote: A medical drug for inhibiting luteinizing hormone secretion is Butinazocine.Deficiency Diminished secretion of LH can result in failure of gonadal function (hypogonadism). This condition is typically manifest in males as failure in production of normal numbers of sperm. In females, amenorrhea  is commonly observed. Conditions with very low LH secretions include: Pasqualini syndrome Kallmann syndrome Hypothalamic suppression Hypopituitarism Eating disorder Female athlete triad Hyperprolactinemia Hypogonadism Gonadal suppression therapy GnRH antagonistGnRH agonist (inducing an initial stimulation (flare up) followed by permanent blockage of the GnRH pituitary receptor)As a medication", "LH  is available mixed with FSH in the form of menotropin, and other forms of urinary gonadotropins. More purified forms of urinary gonadotropins may reduce the LH portion in relation to FSH. Recombinant LH is available as lutropin alfa (Luveris).  All these medications have to be given parenterally. They are commonly used in infertility therapy to stimulate follicular development, the notable one being in IVF therapy.Often, HCG medication is used as an LH substitute because it activates the same receptor. Medically used hCG is derived from urine of pregnant women, is less costly, and has a longer half-life than LH.Role in Phosphorylation Phosphorylation is a biochemical process that involves the addition of phosphate to an organic compound. Steroidogenesis entails processes by which cholesterol is converted to biologically active steroid hormones. Recent study shows that LH via a PKA signaling pathway regulates the phosphorylation and localization of DRP1 within mitochondria of the steroidogenic cells of the ovary.ReferencesExternal links  Recombinant proteinsGlycoproteinsGonadotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropinsMerck brandsPeptide hormonesSex hormonesHuman hormonesHormones of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axisAnterior pituitary hormones"]}}

Many repeaters are located on hilltops or on tall buildings as the higher location increases their coverage area, sometimes referred to as the radio horizon, or \"footprint\". Amateur radio repeaters are similar in concept to those used by public safety entities (police, fire department, etc.), businesses, government, military, and more. Amateur radio repeaters may even use commercially packaged repeater systems that have been adjusted to operate within amateur radio frequency bands, but more often amateur repeaters are assembled from receivers, transmitters, controllers, power supplies, antennas, and other components, from various sources.", "Introduction In amateur radio, repeaters are typically maintained by individual hobbyists or local groups of amateur radio operators.  Many repeaters are provided openly to other amateur radio operators and typically not used as a remote base station by a single user or group. In some areas multiple repeaters are linked together to form a wide-coverage network, such as the linked system provided by the Independent Repeater Association which covers most of western Michigan, or the Western Intertie Network System (\"WINsystem\") that now covers a great deal of California, and is in 17 other states, including Hawaii, along with parts of four other countries, Australia, Canada, Great Britain and Japan.Frequencies Repeaters are found mainly in the VHF 6 meter (50\u201354\u00a0MHz),  2 meter (144\u2013148\u00a0MHz), 1.25-meter band (1 meters) (220\u2013225\u00a0MHz) and the UHF 70 centimeter (420\u2013450\u00a0MHz) bands, but can be used on almost any frequency pair above 28 MHz. In some areas, 33 centimeters (902\u2013928\u00a0MHz) and 23 centimeters (1.24\u20131.3\u00a0GHz) are also used for repeaters.  Note that different countries have different rules; for example, in the United States, the two meter band is 144\u2013148\u00a0MHz, while in the United Kingdom (and most of Europe) it is 144\u2013146\u00a0MHz.", "Repeater frequency sets are known as \"repeater pairs\", and in the ham radio community most follow ad hoc standards for the difference between the two frequencies, commonly called the offset.  In the USA two-meter band, the standard offset is 600\u00a0kHz (0.6\u00a0MHz), but sometimes unusual offsets, referred to as oddball splits, are used. The actual frequency pair used is assigned by a local frequency coordinating council.In the days of crystal-controlled radios, these pairs were identified by the last portion of the transmit (Input) frequency followed by the last portion of the receive (Output) frequency that the ham would put into the radio.  Thus \"three-four nine-four\" (34/94) meant that hams would transmit on 146.34\u00a0MHz and listen on 146.94\u00a0MHz (while the repeater would do the opposite, listening on 146.34 and transmitting on 146.94).  In areas with many repeaters, \"reverse splits\" were common (i.e., 94/34), to prevent interference between systems.", "Since the late 1970s, the use of synthesized, microprocessor-controlled radios, and widespread adoption of standard frequency splits have changed the way repeater pairs are described.  In 1980, a ham might have been told that a repeater was on \"22/82\"\u2014today they will most often be told \"682 down\".  The 6 refers to the last digit of 146\u00a0MHz, so that the display will read \"146.82\" (the output frequency), and the radio is set to transmit \"down\" 600\u00a0kHz on 146.22\u00a0MHz. Another way of describing a repeater frequency pair is to give the repeater's output frequency, along with the direction of offset (\"+\" or \"plus\" for an input frequency above the output frequency, \"\u2212\" or \"minus\" for a lower frequency) with the assumption that the repeater uses the standard offset for the band in question. For instance, a 2-meter repeater might be described as \"147.34 with a plus offset\", meaning that the repeater transmits on 147.34\u00a0MHz and receives on 147.94\u00a0MHz, 600\u00a0kHz above the output frequency.", "Services Services provided by a repeater may include an autopatch connection to a POTS/PSTN telephone line to allow users to make telephone calls from their keypad-equipped radios. These advanced services may be limited to members of the group or club that maintains the repeater.  Many amateur radio repeaters typically have a tone access control (CTCSS, also called CG or PL tone) implemented to prevent them from being keyed-up (operated) accidentally by interference from other radio signals. A few use a digital code system called DCS, DCG or DPL (a Motorola trademark). In the UK most repeaters also respond to a short burst of 1750\u00a0Hz tone to open the repeater.", "In many communities, a repeater has become a major on-the-air gathering spot for the local amateur radio community, especially during \"drive time\" (the morning or afternoon commuting time). In the evenings local public service nets may be heard on these systems and many repeaters are used by weather spotters. In an emergency or a disaster a repeater can sometimes help to provide needed communications between areas that could not otherwise communicate. Until cellular telephones became popular, it was common for community repeaters to have \"drive time\" monitoring stations so that mobile amateurs could call in traffic accidents via the repeater to the monitoring station who could relay it to the local police agencies via telephone. Systems with autopatches frequently had (and still have) most of the public safety agencies numbers programmed as speed-dial numbers.US repeater coordination Repeater coordination is not required by the Federal Communications Commission, nor does the FCC regulate, certify or otherwise regulate frequency coordination for the Amateur Radio Bands.Amateur Radio Repeater Coordinators or coordination groups are all volunteers and have no legal authority to assume jurisdictional or regional control in any area where the Federal Communications Commission regulates the Amateur Radio Service.   The United States Code of Federal Regulations Title 47 CFR, Part 97, which are the laws in which the Amateur Radio Service is regulated clearly states the definition of Frequency Coordinator.", "The purpose of coordinating a repeater or frequency is to reduce harmful interference to other fixed operations.   Coordinating a repeater or frequency with other fixed operations demonstrates good engineering and amateur practice.UK repeaters In the UK, the frequency allocations for repeaters are managed by the Emerging Technology Co-ordination Committee (ETCC) of the Radio Society of Great Britain and licensed by Ofcom, the industry regulator for communications in the UK. Each repeater has a NOV (Notice of Variation) licence issued to a particular amateur radio callsign (this person is normally known as the \"repeater keeper\") thus ensuring the licensing authority has a single point of contact for that particular repeater.Each repeater in the UK is normally supported by a repeater group composed of local amateur radio enthusiasts who pay a nominal amount e.g. \u00a310\u201315 a year each to support the maintenance of each repeater and to pay for site rents, electricity costs etc. Repeater groups do not receive any central funding from other organisations.Such groups include the Central Scotland FM Group and the Scottish Borders Repeater Group.Repeater equipment The most basic repeater consists of an FM receiver on one frequency and an FM transmitter on another frequency usually in the same radio band, connected together so that when the receiver picks up a signal, the transmitter is keyed and rebroadcasts whatever is heard.", "In order to run the repeater a repeater controller is necessary. A repeater controller can be a hardware solution or even be implemented in software.Repeaters typically have a timer to cut off retransmission of a signal that goes too long.  Repeaters operated by groups with an emphasis on emergency communications often limit each transmission to 30 seconds, while others may allow three minutes or even longer.  The timer restarts after a short pause following each transmission, and many systems feature a beep or chirp tone to signal that the timeout timer has reset.Repeater typesConventional repeaters Conventional repeaters, also known as in-band or same-band repeaters, retransmit signals within the same frequency band, and they only repeat signals using a particular modulation scheme, predominately FM.Standard repeaters require either the use of two antennas (one each for transmitter and receiver) or a duplexer to isolate the transmit and receive signals over a single antenna.  The duplexer is a device which prevents the repeater's high-power transmitter (on the output frequency) from drowning out the users' signal on the repeater receiver (on the input frequency). A diplexer allows two transmitters on different frequencies to use one antenna, and is common in installations where one repeater on 2 m and a second on 440\u00a0MHz share one feedline up the tower and one antenna.Most repeaters are remotely controlled through the use of audio tones on a control channel.", "Cross-band repeaters A cross-band repeater (also sometimes called a replexer), is a repeater that retransmits a specific mode on a frequency in one band to a specific mode on a frequency in a different band. This technique allows for a smaller and less complex repeater system. Repeating signals across widely separated frequency bands allows for simple filters to be used to allow one antenna to be used for both transmit and receive at the same time.  This avoids the use of complex duplexers to achieve the required rejection for same band repeating.Some dual-band amateur transceivers are capable of cross-band repeat.Amateur television repeaters Amateur television (ATV) repeaters are used by amateur radio operators to transmit full motion video. The bands used by ATV repeaters vary by country, but in the US a typical configuration is as a cross-band system with an input on the 33 or 23 cm band and output on 421.25\u00a0MHz or, sometimes, 426.25\u00a0MHz (within the 70 cm band). These output frequencies happen to be the same as standard cable television channels 57 and 58, meaning that anyone with a cable-ready analog NTSC TV can tune them in without special equipment.There are also digital amateur TV repeaters that retransmit digital video signals.  Frequently DVB-S modulation is used for digital ATV, due to narrow bandwidth needs and high loss tolerances.  These DATV repeaters are more prevalent in Europe currently, partially because of the availability of DVB-S equipment.Satellite repeaters", "In addition, amateur radio satellites have been launched with the specific purpose of operating as space-borne amateur repeaters.  The worldwide amateur satellite organization AMSAT designs and builds many of the amateur satellites, which are also known as OSCARs.  Several satellites with amateur radio equipment on board have been designed and built by universities around the world.  Also, several OSCARs have been built for experimentation.  For example, NASA and AMSAT coordinated the release of SuitSat which was an attempt to make a low cost experimental satellite from a discarded Russian spacesuit outfitted with amateur radio equipment.The repeaters on board a satellite may be of any type; the key distinction is that they are in orbit around the Earth, rather than terrestrial in nature.  The three most common types of OSCARs are linear transponders, cross-band FM repeaters, and digipeaters (also referred to as pacsats).", "Linear transponders Amateur transponder repeaters are most commonly used on amateur satellites.  A specified band of frequencies, usually having a bandwidth of 20 to 800\u00a0kHz is repeated from one band to another.  Transponders are not mode specific and typically no demodulation occurs.  Any signal with a bandwidth narrower than the transponder's pass-band will be repeated; however, for technical reasons, use of modes other than SSB and CW are discouraged.  Transponders may be inverting or non-inverting.  An example of an inverting transponder would be a 70cm to 2m transponder which receives on the 432.000\u00a0MHz to 432.100\u00a0MHz frequencies and transmits on the 146.000\u00a0MHz to 146.100\u00a0MHz frequencies by inverting the frequency range within the band.  In this example, a signal received at 432.001\u00a0MHz would be transmitted on 146.099\u00a0MHz.  Voice signals using upper sideband modulation on the input would result in a LSB modulation on the output, and vice versa.Store-and-forward systems Another class of repeaters do not simultaneously retransmit a signal, on different frequency, as they receive it.  Instead, they operate in a store-and-forward manner, by receiving and then retransmitting on the same frequency after a short delay.", "These systems may not be legally classified as \"repeaters\", depending on the definition set by a country's regulator.  For example, in the US, the FCC defines a repeater as an \"amateur station that simultaneously retransmits the transmission of another amateur station on a different channel or channels.\" (CFR 47 97.205(b))  Store-and-forward systems neither retransmit simultaneously, nor use a different channel.  Thus, they must be operated under different rules than more conventional repeaters.Simplex repeater A type of system known as a simplex repeater uses a single transceiver and a short-duration voice recorder, which records whatever the receiver picks up for a set length of time (usually 30 seconds or less), then plays back the recording over the transmitter on the same frequency. A common name is a \"parrot\" repeater.Digipeater Another form of repeater used in amateur packet radio, a form of digital computer-to-computer communications, is dubbed \"digipeater\" (for DIGItal rePEATER).  Digipeaters are often used for activities and modes such as packet radio, Automatic Packet Reporting System, and D-STAR's digital data mode. Also commercial digital modes such as DMR, P25 and NXDN. Some modes are full duplex and internet linked.SSTV repeater An SSTV repeater is an amateur radio repeater station that relays slow-scan television signals. A typical SSTV repeater is equipped with a HF or VHF transceiver and a computer with a sound card, which serves as a demodulator/modulator of SSTV signals.", "SSTV repeaters are used by amateur radio operators for exchanging pictures. If two stations cannot copy each other, they can still communicate through a repeater.One type of SSTV repeater is activated by a station sending it a 1,750\u00a0Hz tone. The repeater sends K in morse code to confirm its activation, after which the station must start sending a picture within about 10 seconds. After reception, the received image is transmitted on the repeater's operation frequency. Another type is activated by the SSTV vertical synchronization signal (VIS code).Depending on the software it uses (MMSSTV, JVComm32, MSCAN, for example), an SSTV repeater typically operates in common SSTV modes.", "Repeater networks Repeaters may be linked together in order to form what is known as a linked repeater system or linked repeater network.  In such a system, when one repeater is keyed-up by receiving a signal, all the other repeaters in the network are also activated and will transmit the same signal.  The connections between the repeaters are made via radio (usually on a different frequency from the published transmitting frequency) for maximum reliability.  Some networks have a feature to allow the user being able to turn additional repeaters and links on or off on the network. This feature is typically done with DTMF tones to control the network infrastructure.  Such a system allows coverage over a wide area, enabling communication between amateurs often hundreds of miles (several hundred km) apart.  These systems are used for area or regional communications, for example in Skywarn nets, where storm spotters relay severe weather reports.  All the user has to know is which channel to use in which area.", "Voting systems In order to get better receive coverage over a wide area, a similar linked setup can also be done with what is known as a voted receiver system.  In a voted receiver, there are several satellite receivers set up to receive on the same frequency (the one that the users transmit on).  All of the satellite receivers are linked to a voting selector panel that switches from receiver to receiver  based on the best quieting (strongest) signal, and the output of the selector will actually trigger the central repeater transmitter.  A properly adjusted voting system can switch many times a second and can actually \"assemble\" a multi-syllable word using a different satellite receiver for each syllable. Such a system can be used to widen coverage to low power mobile radios or handheld radios that otherwise would not be able to key up the central location, but can receive the signal from the central location without an issue.  Voting systems require no knowledge or effort on the part of the user - the system just seems to have better-than-average handheld coverage.", "Internet linking Repeaters may also be connected over the Internet using voice over IP (VoIP) techniques.  VoIP links are a convenient way to connecting distant repeaters that would otherwise be unreachable by VHF/UHF radio propagation.  Popular VoIP amateur radio network protocols include D-STAR, Echolink, IRLP, WIRES and eQSO. Digital Mobile Radio (DMR), D-STAR, Fusion, P25 and NXDN all have a codec in the user radio and along with the encoded audio, also send and receive user number and destination information so one can talk to another specific user or a Talk Group. Two such worldwide networks are DMR-MARC and Brandmeister.For example, a simplex gateway may be used to link a simplex repeater into a repeater network via the Internet.Operating terms  Timing Out is the situation where a person talks too long and the repeater timer shuts off the repeater transmitter. Kerchunking is transmitting a momentary signal to check a repeater without identifying. In many countries, such an act violates amateur radio regulations. The term \"Kerchunk\" can also apply to the sound a large FM transmitter makes when the operator switches it off and on. Lid refers to a poor operator (radio methods) usually from improper training from other Amateurs or exposure to different types of operation such as CB radio.ReferencesExternal links  Free information web site devoted to those that build repeaters of any type: amateur, commercial, GMRS, public safety, etc.RepeaterRadio electronics"]}}

It was originally announced as the \"Bally Home Library Computer\" in October 1977 and initially made available for mail order in December 1977. But due to production delays, the units were first released to stores in April 1978 and its branding changed to \"Bally Professional Arcade\". It was marketed only for a limited time before Bally decided to exit the market. The rights were later picked up by a third-party company, who re-released it and sold it until around 1984. The Astrocade is particularly notable for its very powerful graphics capabilities for the time of release, and for the difficulty in accessing those capabilities.HistoryNutting and Midway In the late 1970s, Midway contracted Dave Nutting Associates to design a video display chip that could be used in all of their videogame systems, from standup arcade games, to a home computer system. The system Nutting delivered was used in most of Midway's classic arcade games of the era, including Gorf and Wizard of Wor. The chip set supported what was at that time relatively high resolution of 320\u00d7204 in four colours per line, although to access this mode required memory that could be accessed at a faster rate than the common 2\u00a0MHz dynamic RAM of the era.Console use", "Originally referred to as the Bally Home Library Computer, it was released in 1977 but available only through mail order. Delays in the production meant none of the units actually shipped until 1978, and by this time the machine had been renamed the Bally Professional Arcade. In this form it sold mostly at computer stores and had little retail exposure (unlike the Atari VCS). In 1979, Bally grew less interested in the arcade market and decided to sell off their Consumer Products Division, including development and production of the game console.At about the same time, a third-party group had been unsuccessfully attempting to bring their own console design to market as the Astrovision. A corporate buyer from Montgomery Ward who was in charge of the Bally system put the two groups in contact, and a deal was eventually arranged. In 1981 they re-released the unit with the BASIC cartridge included for free, this time known as the Bally Computer System, with the name changing again, in 1982, to Astrocade. It sold under this name until the video game crash of 1983, and then disappeared around 1985.", "Midway had long been planning to release an expansion system for the unit, known as the ZGRASS-100. The system was being developed by a group of computer artists at the University of Illinois at Chicago known as the 'Circle Graphics Habitat', along with programmers at Nutting. Midway felt that such a system, in an external box, would make the Astrocade more interesting to the market. However it was still not ready for release when Bally sold off the division. A small handful may have been produced as the ZGRASS-32 after the machine was re-released by Astrovision.The system, combined into a single box, would eventually be released as the  Datamax UV-1. Aimed at the home computer market while being designed, the machine was now re-targeted as a system for outputting high-quality graphics to video tape. These were offered for sale some time between 1980 and 1982, but it is unknown how many were built.Description", "The basic system was powered by a Zilog Z80 driving the display chip with a RAM buffer in between the two. The display chip had two modes, a low-resolution mode at 160 \u00d7 102, and a high-resolution mode at 320 \u00d7 204, both with 2-bits per pixel for four colors. This sort of color/resolution was normally beyond the capabilities of RAM of the era, which could not read out the data fast enough to keep up with the TV display. The system used page mode addressing allowing them to read one \"line\" at a time at very high speed into a buffer inside the display chip. The line could then be read out to the screen at a more leisurely rate, while also interfering less with the CPU, which was also trying to use the same memory.On the Astrocade the pins needed to use this \"trick\" were not connected. Thus the Astrocade system was left with just the lower resolution 160 \u00d7 102 mode. In this mode the system used up 160 \u00d7 102 \u00d7 2bits = 4080 bytes of memory to hold the screen. Since the machine had only 4kiB (4096 bytes) of RAM, this left very little room for program functions such as keeping score and game options. The rest of the program would have to be placed in ROM.", "The Astrocade used color registers, or color indirection, so the four colors could be picked from a palette of 256 colors. Color animation was possible by changing the values of the registers, and using a horizontal blank interrupt they could be changed from line to line. An additional set of four color registers could be \"swapped in\" at any point along the line, allowing the creation of two screen \"halves\", split vertically. Originally intended to allow creation of a score area on the side of the screen, programmers also used this feature to emulate 8 color modes.Unlike the VCS, the Astrocade did not include hardware sprite support. It did, however, include a blitter-like system and software to drive it. Memory above 0x4000 was dedicated to the display, and memory below that to the ROM. If a program wrote to the ROM space (normally impossible, it is \"read only\" after all) the video chip would take the data, apply a function to it, and then copy the result into the corresponding location in the RAM. Which function to use was stored in a register in the display chip, and included common instructions like XOR and bit-shift. This allowed the Astrocade to support any number of sprite-like objects independent of hardware, with the downside that it was up to the software to re-draw them when they moved.", "The Astrocade was one of the early cartridge-based systems, using cartridges known as Videocades that were designed to be as close in size and shape as possible to a cassette tape. The unit also included two games built into the ROM, Gunfight and Checkmate, along with the simple but useful Calculator and a \"doodle\" program called Scribbling. Most cartridges included two games, and when they were inserted the machine would reset and display a menu starting with the programs on the cartridge and then listing the four built-in programs. The Astrocade featured a relatively complex input device incorporating several types of control mechanisms: the controller was shaped as a pistol-style grip with trigger switch on the front; a small 4-switch/8-way joystick was placed on top of the grip, and the shaft of the joystick connected to a potentiometer, meaning that the stick could be rotated to double as a paddle controller.", "On the front of the unit was a 24-key \"hex-pad\" keyboard used for selecting games and options as well as operating the calculator. On the back were a number of ports, including connectors for power, the controllers, and an expansion port. One oddity was that the top rear of the unit was empty, and could be opened to store up to 15 cartridges. The system's ability to be upgraded from a video game console to personal computer along with its library of nearly 30 games in 1982 are some reasons that made it more versatile than its main competitors, and was listed by Jeff Rovin as one of the seven major video game suppliers.Astro BASIC The Astrocade also included a BASIC programming language cartridge, written by Jamie Fenton, who expanded Li-Chen Wang's Palo Alto Tiny BASIC. First published as Bally BASIC in 1978. Developing a BASIC interpreter on the system was difficult, because the display alone used up almost all the available RAM. The solution to this problem was to store the BASIC program code in the video RAM.", "This was accomplished by interleaving every bit of the program along with the display itself; BASIC used all the even-numbered bits, and the display the odd-numbered bits. The interpreter would read out two bytes, drop all the odd-numbered bits, and assemble the results into a single byte of code. This was rendered invisible by setting two of the colors to be the same as the other two, such that colors 01 and 11 would be the same (white), so the presence, or lack, of a bit for BASIC had no effect on the screen. Additional memory was scavenged by using fewer lines vertically, only 88 instead of the full 102. This managed to squeeze out 1760 bytes of RAM for BASIC programs. The downside was that most of the graphics system's power was unavailable.Programs were entered via the calculator keypad, with a plastic overlay displaying letters, symbols, and BASIC keywords. These were selected through a set of 4 colored shift keys. For example; typing \"WORD\"(gold) shift then the \"+\" key would result in GOTO.A simple line editor was supported. After typing the line number corresponding to an existing program, each press of the PAUSE key would load the next character from memory.An Astro BASIC program that later became commercialized is Artillery Duel. John Perkins wrote the game first and submitted it to The Arcadian fanzine, from which it was adapted for the Astro BASIC manual. Perkins subsequently developed the Astrocade cartridge of the game.", "Language features Astro BASIC supported the following keywords: Commands: LIST, RUN, STOP, TRACE Statements: PRINT, INPUT Structure: GOTO, GOSUB, RETURN, IF (but no THEN and no ELSE), FOR-TO-STEP/NEXT Graphics: BOX, CLEAR, LINE Tape Commands: :PRINT, :INPUT, :LIST, :RUN Functions: ABS(), CALL(), JX() (specified joystick's horizontal position), JY() (joystick vertical position), KN() (knob status), PX(X,Y) (pixel on or off), RND(), TR() (trigger status) Built-in variables (read only): KP (key press), RM (remainder of last division), SZ (memory size), XY (last LINE position) (write only): SM= (scroll mode), TV= (display ASCII character) (read/write): BC (background color), CX CY (cursor position), FC (foreground color), NT (note time), Math: + - \u00d7 \u00f7 Relational operators: < > = # [not equal] [the language did not support: <= => <>] Logical operators: \u00d7 [AND] + [OR]A period . at the start of the line was equivalent to REM in other BASIC implementations. Certain commands were handled by the keypad instead of by keywords: the RESET button was equivalent to NEW in other interpreters.", "The language supported 26 integer variables A to Z, and two pre-defined arrays, @() - which was stored starting after the program, ascending - and *() - which was stored from the top of memory, descending. The language lacked a DIM statement for dimensioning the arrays, the size of which was determined by available memory (SZ) not used by the program listing (2 bytes per item). Ports were accessed via the array &(), and memory was accessed via the array %(), rather than using PEEK and POKE. While the language lacked strings, KP would provide the ASCII value of a key press, which could be output to TV, meaning that characters could be read in from the keyboard, stored in an array, and then output.The character display was 11 lines of 26 characters across. The resolution for the graphic commands is 88x160, with X ranging from -80 to 79 and Y ranging from -44 to 43.Music could be produced in four ways: The PRINT command, as a side effect, produced a unique tone for each character or keyword displayed. The MU variable converted numbers into notes. Ports 16 through 23 accessed a music synthesizer. The sound-synthesizer variables MO (master oscillator), NM (Noise Mode), NV (Noise Volume), TA (Tone A), TB (Tone B), TC (Tone C), VA (Voice A volume), VB (Voice B volume), VC (Voice C volume), VF (Vibrato Frequency), VR (VibRato). (Added to Astro BASIC but not in Bally BASIC.)", "Sample code The following sample program from the manual demonstrates the joystick input and graphics functions. \"Try your skill... The first player's knob moves the phaser left or right and the trigger shoots... Player two controls the target while player one shoots.\" This listing illustrates how keywords, which were tokenized, were always displayed with a following space.ZGRASS The ZGRASS unit sat under the Astrocade and turned it into a \"real\" computer, including a full keyboard, a math co-processor (FPU), 32k of RAM, and a new 32k ROM containing the GRASS programming language (sometimes referred to as GRAFIX on this machine).  The unit also added I/O ports for a cassette and floppy disk, allowing it to be used with CP/M.Reception Danny Goodman of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games stated in 1983 that Astrocade \"has one of the best graphics and sound packages of any home video game\".SpecificationsCircuit board and cartridges  CPU: Zilog Z80, 1.789\u00a0MHz RAM: 4 kB (up to 64 kB with external modules in the expansion port) ROM: 8 kB Cart ROM: 8 kB Expansion: 64 kB total Ports: 4 controller, 1 expansion, 1 light pen", "Audio Sound chip model: 0066-117XX, also known as the Music Processor, or a custom I/O chip since the sound chip also performs I/O functions.Channel capabilities: There are 3 square wave channels, all with a pitch accuracy of 8-bits (256 possible frequencies from which to choose), which can all play square waves. The chip also has a noise generator, which can be independent from the other 3 square wave channels, or it can add its value to the master oscillator that drives the 3 square wave channels. The master oscillator can be set to different frequencies, which means that the frequency range can be changed for the 3 square wave channels. Volume control: Each channel has independent 4-bit volume control.Miscellaneous features concerning sound: There are hardware registers for vibrato, with two bits for the vibrato speed and 6 bits for vibrato depth. This means that it wouldn't be necessary for vibrato to be done entirely with software.Video Resolution:     True 160\u00d7102 / Basic 160\u00d788 / Expanded RAM 320\u00d7204Colors:         True 8* / Basic 2The bitmap structure of the Bally actually only allows for 4 color settings.

Stations are often affiliated with a radio network which provides content in a common radio format, either in broadcast syndication or simulcast or both.  Radio stations broadcast with several different types of modulation:  AM radio stations transmit in AM (amplitude modulation), FM radio stations transmit in FM (frequency modulation), which are older analog audio standards, while newer digital radio stations transmit in several digital audio standards: DAB (digital audio broadcasting), HD radio,  DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale).  Television broadcasting is a separate service which also uses radio frequencies to broadcast television (video) signals.HistoryThe earliest radio stations were radiotelegraphy systems and did not carry audio. For audio broadcasts to be possible, electronic detection and amplification devices had to be incorporated.", "The thermionic valve (a kind of vacuum tube) was invented in 1904 by the English physicist John Ambrose Fleming. He developed a device he called an \"oscillation valve\" (because it passes current in only one direction). The heated filament, or cathode, was capable of thermionic emission of electrons that would flow to the plate (or anode) when it was at a higher voltage. Electrons, however, could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated and thus not capable of thermionic emission of electrons. Later known as the Fleming valve, it could be used as a rectifier of alternating current and as a radio wave detector. This greatly improved the crystal set which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called cat's whisker. However, what was still required was an amplifier.The triode (mercury-vapor filled with a control grid) was created on March 4, 1906, by the Austrian Robert von Lieben independent from that, on October 25, 1906, Lee De Forest patented his three-element Audion. It wasn't put to practical use until 1912 when its amplifying ability became recognized by researchers.", "By about 1920, valve technology had matured to the point where radio broadcasting was quickly becoming viable. However, an early audio transmission that could be termed a broadcast may have occurred on Christmas Eve in 1906 by Reginald Fessenden, although this is disputed. While many early experimenters attempted to create systems similar to radiotelephone devices by which only two parties were meant to communicate, there were others who intended to transmit to larger audiences. Charles Herrold started broadcasting in California in 1909 and was carrying audio by the next year. (Herrold's station eventually became KCBS).", "In The Hague, the Netherlands, PCGG started broadcasting on November 6, 1919, making it, arguably the first commercial broadcasting station. In 1916, Frank Conrad, an electrical engineer employed at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, began broadcasting from his Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania garage with the call letters 8XK. Later, the station was moved to the top of the Westinghouse factory building in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Westinghouse relaunched the station as KDKA on November 2, 1920, as the first commercially licensed radio station in the United States. The commercial broadcasting designation came from the type of broadcast license; advertisements did not air until years later. The first licensed broadcast in the United States came from KDKA itself: the results of the Harding/Cox Presidential Election. The Montreal station that became CFCF began broadcast programming on May 20, 1920, and the Detroit station that became WWJ began program broadcasts beginning on August 20, 1920, although neither held a license at the time.", "In 1920, wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in the UK from the Marconi Research Centre 2MT at Writtle near Chelmsford, England. A famous broadcast from Marconi's New Street Works factory in Chelmsford was made by the famous soprano Dame Nellie Melba on June 15, 1920, where she sang two arias and her famous trill. She was the first artist of international renown to participate in direct radio broadcasts. The 2MT station began to broadcast regular entertainment in 1922. The BBC was amalgamated in 1922 and received a Royal Charter in 1926, making it the first national broadcaster in the world, followed by Czech Radio and other European broadcasters in 1923.Radio Argentina began regularly scheduled transmissions from the Teatro Coliseo in Buenos Aires on August 27, 1920, making its own priority claim. The station got its license on November 19, 1923. The delay was due to the lack of official Argentine licensing procedures before that date. This station continued regular broadcasting of entertainment and cultural fare for several decades.Radio in education soon followed and colleges across the U.S. began adding radio broadcasting courses to their curricula. Curry College in Milton, Massachusetts introduced one of the first broadcasting majors in 1932 when the college teamed up with WLOE in Boston to have students broadcast programs. By 1931, a majority of U.S. households owned at least one radio receiver.", "In line to ITU Radio Regulations (article1.61) each broadcasting station shall be classified by the service in which it operates permanently or temporarily.TypesBroadcasting by radio takes several forms. These include AM and FM stations. There are several subtypes, namely commercial broadcasting, non-commercial educational (NCE) public broadcasting and non-profit varieties as well as community radio, student-run campus radio stations, and hospital radio stations can be found throughout the world. Many stations broadcast on shortwave bands using AM technology that can be received over thousands of miles (especially at night). For example, the BBC, VOA, VOR, and Deutsche Welle have transmitted via shortwave to Africa and Asia. These broadcasts are very sensitive to atmospheric conditions and solar activity.Nielsen Audio, formerly known as Arbitron, the United States-based company that reports on radio audiences, defines a \"radio station\" as a government-licensed AM or FM station; an HD Radio (primary or multicast) station; an internet stream of an existing government-licensed station; one of the satellite radio channels from XM Satellite Radio or Sirius Satellite Radio; or, potentially, a station that is not government licensed.AM", "AM stations were the earliest broadcasting stations to be developed. AM refers to amplitude modulation, a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted. The medium-wave band is used worldwide for AM broadcasting. Europe also uses the long wave band. In response to the growing popularity of FM stereo radio stations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some North American stations began broadcasting in AM stereo, though this never gained popularity, and very few receivers were ever sold.The signal is subject to interference from electrical storms (lightning) and other electromagnetic interference (EMI). One advantage of AM radio signal is that it can be detected (turned into sound) with simple equipment. If a signal is strong enough, not even a power source is needed; building an unpowered crystal radio receiver was a common childhood project in the early decades of AM broadcasting.AM broadcasts occur on North American airwaves in the medium wave frequency range of 525 to 1,705 kHz (known as the \u201cstandard broadcast band\u201d). The band was expanded in the 1990s by adding nine channels from 1,605 to 1,705\u00a0kHz. Channels are spaced every 10\u00a0kHz in the Americas, and generally every 9\u00a0kHz everywhere else.", "AM transmissions cannot be ionospherically propagated during the day due to strong absorption in the D-layer of the ionosphere. In a crowded channel environment, this means that the power of regional channels which share a frequency must be reduced at night or directionally beamed in order to avoid interference, which reduces the potential nighttime audience. Some stations have frequencies unshared with other stations in North America; these are called clear-channel stations. Many of them can be heard across much of the country at night. During the night, absorption largely disappears and permits signals to travel to much more distant locations via ionospheric reflections. However, fading of the signal can be severe at night.", "AM radio transmitters can transmit audio frequencies up to 15\u00a0kHz (now limited to 10\u00a0kHz in the US due to FCC rules designed to reduce interference), but most receivers are only capable of reproducing frequencies up to 5\u00a0kHz or less. At the time that AM broadcasting began in the 1920s, this provided adequate fidelity for existing microphones, 78 rpm recordings, and loudspeakers. The fidelity of sound equipment subsequently improved considerably, but the receivers did not. Reducing the bandwidth of the receivers reduces the cost of manufacturing and makes them less prone to interference. AM stations are never assigned adjacent channels in the same service area. This prevents the sideband power generated by two stations from interfering with each other. Bob Carver created an AM stereo tuner employing notch filtering that demonstrated that an AM broadcast can meet or exceed the 15\u00a0kHz baseband bandwidth allotted to FM stations without objectionable interference. After several years, the tuner was discontinued. Bob Carver had left the company and the Carver Corporation later cut the number of models produced before discontinuing production completely.", "As well as on the medium wave bands, amplitude modulation (AM) is also used on the shortwave and long wave bands.  Shortwave is used largely for national broadcasters, international propaganda, or religious broadcasting organizations. Shorwave transmissions can have international or inter-continental range depending on atmospheric conditions.  Long-wave AM broadcasting occurs in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The ground wave propagation at these frequencies is little affected by daily changes in the ionosphere, so broadcasters need not reduce power at night to avoid interference with other transmitters.FMFM refers to frequency modulation, and occurs on VHF airwaves in the frequency range of 88 to 108 MHz everywhere except Japan and Russia. Russia, like the former Soviet Union, uses 65.9 to 74\u00a0MHz frequencies in addition to the world standard. Japan uses the 76 to 90\u00a0MHz frequency band.", "Edwin Howard Armstrong invented FM radio to overcome the problem of radio-frequency interference (RFI), which plagued AM radio reception. At the same time, greater fidelity was made possible by spacing stations further apart in the radio frequency spectrum. Instead of 10\u00a0kHz apart, as on the AM band in the US, FM channels are 200\u00a0kHz (0.2\u00a0MHz) apart. In other countries, greater spacing is sometimes mandatory, such as in New Zealand, which uses 700\u00a0kHz spacing (previously 800\u00a0kHz). The improved fidelity made available was far in advance of the audio equipment of the 1940s, but wide interchannel spacing was chosen to take advantage of the noise-suppressing feature of wideband FM.Bandwidth of 200 kHz is not needed to accommodate an audio signal \u2014 20\u00a0kHz to 30\u00a0kHz is all that is necessary for a narrowband FM signal. The 200\u00a0kHz bandwidth allowed room for \u00b175\u00a0kHz signal deviation from the assigned frequency, plus guard bands to reduce or eliminate adjacent channel interference. The larger bandwidth allows for broadcasting a 15\u00a0kHz bandwidth audio signal plus a 38\u00a0kHz stereo \"subcarrier\"\u2014a piggyback signal that rides on the main signal. Additional unused capacity is used by some broadcasters to transmit utility functions such as background music for public areas, GPS auxiliary signals, or financial market data.", "The AM radio problem of interference at night was addressed in a different way. At the time FM was set up, the available frequencies were far higher in the spectrum than those used for AM radio - by a factor of approximately 100. Using these frequencies meant that even at far higher power, the range of a given FM signal was much shorter; thus its market was more local than for AM radio. The reception range at night is the same as in the daytime. All FM broadcast transmissions are line-of-sight, and ionospheric bounce is not viable. The much larger bandwidths, compared to AM and SSB, are more susceptible to phase dispersion. Propagation speeds (celerities) are fastest in the ionosphere at the lowest sideband frequency. The celerity difference between the highest and lowest sidebands is quite apparent to the listener. Such distortion occurs up to frequencies of approximately 50\u00a0MHz. Higher frequencies do not reflect from the ionosphere, nor from storm clouds. Moon reflections have been used in some experiments, but require impractical power levels.", "The original FM radio service in the U.S. was the Yankee Network, located in New England. Regular FM broadcasting began in 1939 but did not pose a significant threat to the AM broadcasting industry. It required purchase of a special receiver. The frequencies used, 42 to 50\u00a0MHz, were not those used today. The change to the current frequencies, 88 to 108\u00a0MHz, began after the end of World War II and was to some extent imposed by AM broadcasters as an attempt to cripple what was by now realized to be a potentially serious threat.FM radio on the new band had to begin from the ground floor. As a commercial venture, it remained a little-used audio enthusiasts' medium until the 1960s. The more prosperous AM stations, or their owners, acquired FM licenses and often broadcast the same programming on the FM station as on the AM station (\"simulcasting\"). The FCC limited this practice in the 1960s. By the 1980s, since almost all new radios included both AM and FM tuners, FM became the dominant medium, especially in cities. Because of its greater range, AM remained more common in rural environments.Pirate radio", "Pirate radio is illegal or non-regulated radio transmission. It is most commonly used to describe illegal broadcasting for entertainment or political purposes. Sometimes it is used for illegal two-way radio operation. Its history can be traced back to the unlicensed nature of the transmission, but historically there has been occasional use of sea vessels\u2014fitting the most common perception of a pirate\u2014as broadcasting bases.Rules and regulations vary largely from country to country, but often the term pirate radio describes the unlicensed broadcast of FM radio, AM radio, or shortwave signals over a wide range. In some places, radio stations are legal where the signal is transmitted, but illegal where the signals are received\u2014especially when the signals cross a national boundary. In other cases, a broadcast may be considered \"pirate\" due to the type of content, its transmission format, or the transmitting power (wattage) of the station, even if the transmission is not technically illegal (such as a webcast or an amateur radio transmission). Pirate radio stations are sometimes referred to as bootleg radio or clandestine stations.Terrestrial digital radio", "Digital radio broadcasting has emerged, first in Europe (the UK in 1995 and Germany in 1999), and later in the United States, France, the Netherlands, South Africa, and many other countries worldwide. The simplest system is named DAB Digital Radio, for Digital Audio Broadcasting, and uses the public domain EUREKA 147 (Band III) system. DAB is used mainly in the UK and South Africa. Germany and the Netherlands use the DAB and DAB+ systems, and France uses the L-Band system of DAB Digital Radio.The broadcasting regulators of the United States and Canada have chosen to use HD radio, an in-band on-channel system that puts digital broadcasts at frequencies adjacent to the analog broadcast. HD Radio is owned by a consortium of private companies that is called iBiquity. An international non-profit consortium Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), has introduced the public domain DRM system, which is used by a relatively small number of broadcasters worldwide.International broadcastingBroadcasters in one country have several reasons to reach out to an audience in other countries. Commercial broadcasters may simply see a business opportunity to sell advertising or subscriptions to a broader audience. This is more efficient than broadcasting to a single country, because domestic entertainment programs and information gathered by domestic news staff can be cheaply repackaged for non-domestic audiences.", "Governments typically have different motivations for funding international broadcasting. One clear reason is for ideological, or propaganda reasons. Many government-owned stations portray their nation in a positive, non-threatening way. This could be to encourage business investment in or tourism to the nation. Another reason is to combat a negative image produced by other nations or internal dissidents, or insurgents. Radio RSA, the broadcasting arm of the apartheid South African government, is an example of this. A third reason is to promote the ideology of the broadcaster. For example, a program on Radio Moscow from the 1960s to the 1980s was What is Communism?A second reason is to advance a nation's foreign policy interests and agenda by disseminating its views on international affairs or on the events in particular parts of the world. During the Cold War the American Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty and Indian Radio AIR were founded to broadcast news from \"behind the Iron Curtain\" that was otherwise being censored and promote dissent and occasionally, to disseminate disinformation. Currently, the US operates similar services aimed at Cuba (Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Mart\u00ed) and the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, Laos  and North Korea (Radio Free Asia).", "Besides ideological reasons, many stations are run by religious broadcasters and are used to provide religious education, religious music, or worship service programs. For example, Vatican Radio, established in 1931, broadcasts such programs. Another station, such as HCJB or Trans World Radio will carry brokered programming from evangelists. In the case of the Broadcasting Services of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, both governmental and religious programming is provided.ExtensionsExtensions of traditional radio-wave broadcasting for audio broadcasting in general include cable radio, local wire television networks, DTV radio, satellite radio, and internet radio via streaming media on the Internet.SatelliteThe enormous entry costs of space-based satellite transmitters and restrictions on available radio spectrum licenses has restricted growth of Satellite radio broadcasts. In the US and Canada, just two services, XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio exist. Both XM and Sirius are owned by Sirius XM Satellite Radio, which was formed by the merger of XM and Sirius on July 29, 2008, whereas in Canada, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada remained separate companies until 2010. Worldspace in Africa and Asia, and MobaHO! in Japan and the ROK were two unsuccessful satellite radio operators which have gone out of business.Program formats", "Radio program formats differ by country, regulation, and markets. For instance, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission designates the 88\u201392 megahertz band in the U.S. for non-profit or educational programming, with advertising prohibited.In addition, formats change in popularity as time passes and technology improves. Early radio equipment only allowed program material to be broadcast in real time, known as live broadcasting. As technology for sound recording improved, an increasing proportion of broadcast programming used pre-recorded material. A current trend is the automation of radio stations. Some stations now operate without direct human intervention by using entirely pre-recorded material sequenced by computer control.See also Broadcasting construction permit Call sign Disc jockey (DJ) History of broadcasting International broadcasting List of radio topics Low power radio station Radio Radio antenna Radio network Radio personality RF modulation Sports commentator Television stationReferencesExternal links", "Federal Communications Commission website - fcc.govDXing.info - Information about radio stations worldwideRadio-Locator.com- Links to 13,000 radio stations worldwideBBC reception adviceDXradio.50webs.com \"The SWDXER\" - with general SWL information and radio antenna tipsRadioStationZone.com - 10.000+ radio stations worldwide with ratings, comments and listen live linksOnline-Radio-Stations.org - The Web Radio Tuner has a comprehensive list of over 50.000 radio stationsUnwantedEmissions.com - A general reference to radio spectrum allocationsRadio stanice - Search for radio stations throughout the EuropeRadio Emisoras Latinas - has a directory with thousands of Latin America Radio Stations"]}}

{"put": "id:en:doc::doc-en-766702", "fields": {"id": "doc-en-766702", "text": ["Amateur radio frequency allocation is done by national telecommunication authorities.  Globally, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) oversees how much radio spectrum is set aside for amateur radio transmissions. Individual amateur stations are free to use any frequency within authorized frequency ranges; authorized bands may vary by the class of the station license.Radio amateurs use a variety of transmission modes, including Morse code, radioteletype, data, and voice. Specific frequency allocations vary from country to country and between ITU regions as specified in the current ITU HF frequency allocations for amateur radio. The list of frequency ranges is called a band allocation, which may be set by international agreements, and national regulations. The modes and types of allocations within each frequency band is called a bandplan; it may be determined by regulation, but most typically is set by agreements between amateur radio operators.National authorities regulate amateur usage of radio bands. Some bands may not be available or may have restrictions on usage in certain countries or regions. International agreements assign amateur radio bands which differ by region.Band characteristicsLow frequency 2200 meters \u2013 135.7\u2013137.8\u00a0kHz \u2013 just below the Asian and European longwave broadcast band and far below the commercial AM broadcast band.Medium frequency", "630\u00a0meters \u2013 472\u2013479\u00a0kHz \u2013 just below the commercial AM broadcast band and the maritime radio band.160 meters \u2013 1800\u20132000\u00a0kHz (1.8-2\u00a0MHz) \u2013 just above the commercial AM broadcast band. This band is often taken up as a technical challenge, since long distance (DX) propagation tends to be more difficult due to higher D\u00a0layer ionospheric absorption. Long distance propagation tends to occur only at night, and the band can be notoriously noisy particularly in the summer months. 160\u00a0meters is also known as the \"top band\". Allocations in this band vary widely from country to country.High frequency", "80\u00a0meters \u2013 3.5\u20134.0\u00a0MHz (3500\u20134000\u00a0kHz) \u2013 Best at night, with significant daytime signal absorption. Works best in winter due to atmospheric noise in summer. Only countries in the Americas and few others have access to all of this band, in other parts of the world amateurs are limited to the bottom 300\u00a0kHz (or less). In the US and Canada the upper end of the sub-band from 3.6\u20134.0\u00a0MHz, permits use of single-sideband voice as well as amplitude modulation, voice; this sub-band is often referred to as \"75\u00a0meters\".60\u00a0meters \u2013 5\u00a0MHz region \u2013 A relatively new allocation and originally only available in a small number of countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, but now continuing to expand. In most (but not all) countries, the allocation is channelized and may require special application. Five channels are available in the US, centered on 5.332, 5.348, 5.368, 5.373, and 5.405\u00a0MHz; since most SSB radios display the (suppressed) carrier frequency, in USB mode the dial frequencies would all be 1.5\u00a0kHz lower. Voice operation is generally in upper sideband mode and in the USA it is mandatory. The 2015 ITU World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC-15) approved a Worldwide Frequency Allocation of 5.351.5\u20135.366.5\u00a0MHz to the Amateur Service on a secondary basis. The allocation limits amateur stations to 15\u00a0Watts effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP); however some locations will be permitted up to 25\u00a0W EIRP.", "40\u00a0meters \u2013 7.0\u20137.3\u00a0MHz \u2013 Considered the most reliable all-season DX band. Popular for DX at night, 40 meters is also reliable for medium distance (1500\u00a0km; 1000 miles) contacts during the day.  Much of this band was shared with broadcasters, and in most countries the bottom 100\u00a0kHz or 200\u00a0kHz are available to amateurs. However, due to the high cost of running high-power commercial broadcasting facilities, decreased listenership, and increasing competition from Internet-based international broadcast services, many \"short wave\" services are being shut down, leaving the 40\u00a0meter band free of other users for amateur radio use.30\u00a0meters \u2013 10.1\u201310.15\u00a0MHz \u2013 a very narrow band, which is shared with non-amateur services.  It is recommended that only Morse Code and data transmissions be used here, and in some countries amateur voice transmission is actually prohibited. For example, in the US, data, RTTY and CW are the only modes allowed at a maximum 200\u00a0W peak envelope power (PEP) output. Not released for amateur use in a small number of countries.  Due to its location in the centre of the shortwave spectrum, this band provides significant opportunities for long-distance communication at all points of the solar cycle. 30\u00a0meters is a WARC band. \"WARC\" bands are so called due to the 1979 special World Administrative Radio Conference allocation of these newer bands to amateur radio use.  Amateur radio contests are not run on the WARC bands.", "20\u00a0meters \u2013 14.0\u201314.35\u00a0MHz \u2013 Considered the most popular DX band; usually most popular during daytime. QRP operators recognize 14.060\u00a0MHz as their primary calling frequency in that band. Users of the PSK31 data mode tend to congregate around 14.070\u00a0MHz.

Propagates via Sporadic E and by F2 propagation.", "10\u00a0meters \u2013 28\u201329.7\u00a0MHz \u2013 Best long distance (e.g., across oceans) activity is during solar maximum; during periods of moderate solar activity the best activity is found at low latitudes. The band offers useful short to medium range groundwave propagation, day or night. Due to Sporadic\u00a0E propagation during the late spring and most of the summer, regardless of sunspot numbers, afternoon short band openings into small geographic areas of up to 1500\u00a0km; 1000 miles occur. Sporadic\u00a0E is caused by areas of intense ionization in the E\u00a0layer of the ionosphere. The causes of Sporadic E are not fully understood, but these \"clouds\" of ionization can provide short-term propagation from 17\u00a0meters all the way up to occasional 2\u00a0meter openings. FM operations are normally found at the high end of the band (Also repeaters are in the 29.5\u201329.7\u00a0MHz segment in many countries).", "Very high frequencies and ultra high frequencies Frequencies above 30\u00a0MHz are referred to as Very High Frequency (VHF) region and those above 300\u00a0MHz are called Ultra High Frequency (UHF). The allocated bands for amateurs are many megahertz wide, allowing for high-fidelity audio transmission modes (FM) and very fast data transmission modes that are unfeasible for the kilohertz-wide allocations in the HF bands.6\u00a0meters \u2013 50\u201354\u00a0MHz4\u00a0meters \u2013 70\u201370.5\u00a0MHz2\u00a0meters \u2013 144\u2013148\u00a0MHz1.25\u00a0meters \u2013 219\u2013220\u00a0MHz (Canada only), 222\u2013225\u00a0MHz (US & Canada)70\u00a0centimeters \u2013 420\u2013450\u00a0MHz33\u00a0centimeters \u2013 902\u2013928\u00a0MHz23\u00a0centimeters \u2013 1240\u20131300\u00a0MHz (1240\u20131325\u00a0MHz in UK)13\u00a0centimeters \u2013 2300\u20132310\u00a0MHz (lower segment), 2390\u20132450\u00a0MHz (upper segment)While \"line of sight\" propagation is a primary factor for range calculation, much of the interest in the bands above HF comes from use of other propagation modes. A signal transmitted on VHF from a hand-held portable will typically travel about 5\u201310\u00a0km (3 to 6 miles) depending on terrain. With a low power home station and a simple antenna, range would be around 50\u00a0km (30 miles).With a large antenna system like a long yagi, and higher power (typically 100\u00a0Watts or more) contacts of around 1000\u00a0km (600 miles) using the Morse code (CW) and single-sideband (SSB) modes are common. Ham operators seek to exploit the limits of the frequencies usual characteristics looking to learn, understand, and experiment with the possibilities of these enhanced propagation modes.", "Sporadic band openingsOccasionally, several different ionospheric conditions allow signals to travel beyond the ordinary line-of-sight limits. Some amateurs on VHF seek to take advantage of \"band openings\" where natural occurrences in the atmosphere and ionosphere extend radio transmission distances well over their normal range. Many hams listen for hours hoping to take advantage of these occasional extended propagation \"openings\".The ionospheric conditions are called Sporadic E and Anomalous enhancement. Less frequently used anomalous modes are tropospheric scatter and Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights). When overhead, moon bounce and satellite relay are also possible.Sporadic ESome openings are caused by islands of intense ionization of the upper atmosphere known as the E Layer ionosphere. These islands of intense ionization are called \"Sporadic\u00a0E\" and result in erratic but often strong propagation characteristics on the \"low band\" VHF radio frequencies.The 6\u00a0meter amateur band falls into this category, often called \"The Magic Band\", 6\u00a0meters will often \"open up\" from one small area into another small geographic area 1000\u20131700\u00a0km (600 to 1000 miles) away during the spring and early summer months. This phenomenon occurs during the fall months, although not as often.", "Tropospheric refractionBand openings are sometimes caused by a weather phenomenon known as a tropospheric \"inversion\", where a stagnant high pressure area causes alternating stratified layers of warm and cold air generally trapping the colder air beneath. This may make for smoggy/foggy days but it also causes VHF/UHF radio transmissions to travel or duct along the boundaries of these warm/cold atmospheric layers. Radio signals have been known to travel hundreds, even thousands of kilometers (miles) due to these unique weather conditions.For example: The longest distance reported contact due to tropospheric refraction on 2\u00a0meters is 4754\u00a0km (2954 miles) between Hawaii and a ship south of Mexico. There were reports of the reception of one way signals from R\u00e9union to Western Australia, a distance of more than 6000\u00a0km (4000 miles).\"Tropo-scatter\" happens when water droplets and dust particles refract a VHF/UHF signal over the horizon. Using relatively high power and a high gain antenna, this propagation will give marginal enhanced over-the-horizon VHF and UHF communications up to several hundred kilometers (miles). During the 1970s commercial \"scatter site\" operators using huge parabolic antennas and high power used this mode successfully for telephone communications services into remote Alaska and Canadian northern communities.", "Satellite, buried fiber optic, and terrestrial microwave access have relegated commercial use of tropo-scatter to the history books. Because of high cost and complexity this mode is usually out of reach for the average amateur radio operator.Anomalous trans-equatorial enhancementF2 and TE band openings from other ionospheric reflection/refraction modes, or sky-wave propagation as it is known can also occasionally occur on the low band VHF frequencies of 6 or 4\u00a0meters, and very rarely on 2\u00a0meters (high band VHF) during extreme peaks in the 11\u00a0year sunspot cycle.The longest terrestrial contact ever reported on 2\u00a0meters (146\u00a0MHz) was between a station in Italy and a station in South Africa, a distance of 7784\u00a0km (4837 miles), using anomalous enhancement (TE) of the ionosphere over the geomagnetic equator. This enhancement is known as TE, or trans-equatorial propagation and (usually) occurs at latitudes 2500\u20133000\u00a0km (1500 to 1900 miles) within either side of the equator.", "Auroral backscatterAn intense solar storm causing aurora borealis (northern lights) will also provide occasional propagation enhancement to HF-low (6-meter) band radio waves. Aurorae only occasionally affect signals on the 2-meter band. Signals are often distorted and on the lower frequencies give a curious \"watery sound\" to normally propagated HF signals. Peak signals usually come from the north, even if the signal originates from a station to the east or west of the receiver. This effect is most significant in the northern latitudes above 45\u00a0degrees.Moon Bounce (Earth-Moon-Earth)Amateurs do successfully communicate by bouncing their signals off the surface of the moon, called Earth-Moon-Earth (EME) transmission.The mode requires moderately high power (more than 500\u00a0Watts) and a fairly large, high-gain antenna because round-trip path loss is on the order of 270\u00a0dB for 70\u00a0cm signals. Return signals are weak and distorted because of the relative velocities of the transmitting station, moon and the receiving station. The moon's surface is also very rocky and irregular.Because of the weak, distorted return signals, Moon bounce communications use digital modes. For example, old-fashioned Morse code or modern JT65, designed for working with weak signals.Satellite relaySatellite relay is not really a propagation mode, but rather an active repeater system. Satellites have been highly successful in providing VHF/UHF/SHF users \"propagation\" beyond the horizon.", "Amateurs have sponsored the launch of dozens of communications satellites since the 1970s. These satellites are usually known as OSCARs (Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio). Also, the ISS has amateur radio repeaters and radio location services on board.Amateur television Amateur television (ATV) is the hobby of transmitting broadcast- compatible video and audio by amateur radio.  It also includes the study and building of such transmitters and receivers and the propagation between these two.In NTSC countries, ATV operation requires the ability to use a 6\u00a0MHz wide channel.  All bands at VHF or lower are less than 6\u00a0MHz wide, so ATV operation is confined to UHF and up.  Bandwidth requirements will vary from this for PAL and SECAM transmissions.ATV operation in the 70\u00a0cm band is particularly popular, because the signals can be received on any cable-ready television.  Operation in the 33\u00a0cm and 23\u00a0cm bands is easily augmented by the availability of various varieties of consumer-grade wireless video devices that exist and operate in unlicensed frequencies coincident to these bands.Repeater ATV operation requires specially-equipped repeaters.See also slow-scan television.", "Below the MW broadcast bandSee also 500 kHz, 630-meter band and 2200-meter bandHistorically, amateur stations have rarely been allowed to operate on frequencies lower than the medium-wave broadcast band, but in recent times, as the historic users of these low frequencies have been vacating the spectrum, limited space has opened up to allow for new amateur radio allocations and special experimental operations.Since parts of the 500\u00a0kHz band are no longer used for regular maritime communications, some countries permit amateur radio radiotelegraph operations in that band. Many countries, however, continue to restrict these frequencies which were historically reserved for maritime and aviation distress calls. The 2200\u00a0meter band is available for use in several countries, and the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-07) made it a worldwide amateur allocation. Before the introduction of the 2200\u00a0meter band in the UK in 1998, operation on the even lower frequency of 73\u00a0kHz had been allowed between 1996 and 2003.ITU Region 1 ITU Region 1 corresponds to Europe, Russia, Africa and the Middle East.

As such, the Amateur Radio Service is not permitted to engage in satellite operations; however, a sister radio service, called the Amateur Satellite Service, exists which allows satellite operations for the same purposes as the Amateur Radio Service.In most countries, an amateur radio license conveys operating privileges in both services, and in practice, the legal distinction between the two services is transparent to the average licensee. The primary reason the two services are separate is to limit the frequencies available for satellite operations.  Due to the shared nature of the amateur radio allocations internationally, and the nature of satellites to roam worldwide, the ITU does not consider all amateur radio bands appropriate for satellite operations.  Being separate from the Amateur Radio Service, the Amateur Satellite Service receives its own frequency allocations.

{"put": "id:en:doc::doc-en-767157", "fields": {"id": "doc-en-767157", "text": ["A geomagnetic storm, also known as a magnetic storm, is a temporary disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere caused by a solar wind shock wave and/or cloud of magnetic field that interacts with the Earth's magnetic field.The disturbance that drives the magnetic storm may be a solar coronal mass ejection (CME) or (much less severely) a co-rotating interaction region (CIR), a high-speed stream of solar wind originating from a coronal hole. The frequency of geomagnetic storms increases and decreases with the sunspot cycle. During solar maximum, geomagnetic storms occur more often, with the majority driven by CMEs.The increase in the solar wind pressure initially compresses the magnetosphere. The solar wind's magnetic field interacts with the Earth's magnetic field and transfers an increased energy into the magnetosphere. Both interactions cause an increase in plasma movement through the magnetosphere (driven by increased electric fields inside the magnetosphere) and an increase in electric current in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. During the main phase of a geomagnetic storm, electric current in the magnetosphere creates a magnetic force that pushes out the boundary between the magnetosphere and the solar wind.", "Several space weather phenomena tend to be associated with or are caused by a geomagnetic storm. These include solar energetic particle (SEP) events, geomagnetically induced currents (GIC), ionospheric disturbances that cause radio and radar scintillation, disruption of navigation by magnetic compass and auroral displays at much lower latitudes than normal.The largest recorded geomagnetic storm, the Carrington Event in September 1859, took down parts of the recently created US telegraph network, starting fires and shocking some telegraph operators. In 1989, a geomagnetic storm energized ground induced currents that disrupted electric power distribution throughout most of Quebec and caused aurorae as far south as Texas.DefinitionA geomagnetic storm is defined by changes in the Dst (disturbance \u2013 storm time) index. The Dst index estimates the globally averaged change of the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field at the magnetic equator based on measurements from a few magnetometer stations. Dst is computed once per hour and reported in near-real-time. During quiet times, Dst is between +20 and \u221220 nano-Tesla (nT).", "A geomagnetic storm has three phases: initial, main and recovery. The initial phase is characterized by Dst (or its one-minute component SYM-H) increasing by 20 to 50\u00a0nT in tens of minutes. The initial phase is also referred to as a storm sudden commencement (SSC). However, not all geomagnetic storms have an initial phase and not all sudden increases in Dst or SYM-H are followed by a geomagnetic storm. The main phase of a geomagnetic storm is defined by Dst decreasing to less than \u221250\u00a0nT. The selection of \u221250\u00a0nT to define a storm is somewhat arbitrary. The minimum value during a storm will be between \u221250 and approximately \u2212600\u00a0nT. The duration of the main phase is typically 2\u20138 hours. The recovery phase is when Dst changes from its minimum value to its quiet time value. The recovery phase may last as short as 8 hours or as long as 7 days.The size of a geomagnetic storm is classified as moderate (\u221250\u00a0nT > minimum of Dst > \u2212100\u00a0nT), intense (\u2212100\u00a0nT > minimum Dst > \u2212250\u00a0nT) or super-storm (minimum of Dst < \u2212250\u00a0nT).Measuring intensity Geomagnetic storm intensity is reported in several different ways, including: K-index A-index The G-scale used by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which rates the storm from G1 to G5 (i.e. G1, G2, G3, G4, G5 in order), where G1 is the weakest storm classification (corresponding to a Kp value of 5), and G5 is the strongest (corresponding to a Kp value of 9).", "History of the theory In 1931, Sydney Chapman and Vincenzo C. A. Ferraro wrote an article, A New Theory of Magnetic Storms, that sought to explain the phenomenon. They argued that whenever the Sun emits a solar flare it also emits a plasma cloud, now known as a coronal mass ejection. They postulated that this plasma travels at a velocity such that it reaches Earth within 113 days, though we now know this journey takes 1 to 5 days. They wrote that the cloud then compresses the Earth's magnetic field and thus increases this field at the Earth's surface. Chapman and Ferraro's work drew on that of, among others, Kristian Birkeland, who had used recently-discovered cathode ray tubes to show that the rays were deflected towards the poles of a magnetic sphere. He theorised that a similar phenomenon was responsible for auroras, explaining why they are more frequent in polar regions.OccurrencesThe first scientific observation of the effects of a geomagnetic storm occurred early in the 19th century: from May 1806 until June 1807, Alexander von Humboldt recorded the bearing of a magnetic compass in Berlin. On 21 December 1806, he noticed that his compass had become erratic during a bright auroral event.", "On September 1\u20132, 1859, the largest recorded geomagnetic storm occurred. From August 28 until September 2, 1859, numerous sunspots and solar flares were observed on the Sun, with the largest flare on September 1. This is referred to as the Solar storm of 1859 or the Carrington Event. It can be assumed that a massive coronal mass ejection (CME) was launched from the Sun and reached the Earth within eighteen hours\u2014a trip that normally takes three to four days. The horizontal field was reduced by 1600\u00a0nT as recorded by the Colaba Observatory. It is estimated that Dst would have been approximately \u22121760\u00a0nT. Telegraph wires in both the United States and Europe experienced induced voltage increases (emf), in some cases even delivering shocks to telegraph operators and igniting fires. Aurorae were seen as far south as Hawaii, Mexico, Cuba and Italy\u2014phenomena that are usually only visible in polar regions. Ice cores show evidence that events of similar intensity recur at an average rate of approximately once per 500 years.Since 1859, less severe storms have occurred, notably the aurora of November 17, 1882 and the May 1921 geomagnetic storm, both with disruption of telegraph service and initiation of fires, and 1960, when widespread radio disruption was reported.", "In early August 1972, a series of flares and solar storms peaks with a flare estimated around X20 producing the fastest CME transit ever recorded and a severe geomagnetic and proton storm that disrupted terrestrial electrical and communications networks, as well as satellites (at least one made permanently inoperative), and spontaneously detonated numerous U.S. Navy magnetic-influence sea mines in North Vietnam.The March 1989 geomagnetic storm caused the collapse of the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec power grid in seconds as equipment protection relays tripped in a cascading sequence. Six million people were left without power for nine hours. The storm caused auroras as far south as Texas. The storm causing this event was the result of a coronal mass ejected from the Sun on March 9, 1989. The minimum Dst was \u2212589\u00a0nT.On July 14, 2000, an X5 class flare erupted (known as the Bastille Day event) and a coronal mass was launched directly at the Earth. A geomagnetic super storm occurred on July 15\u201317; the minimum of the Dst index was \u2212301\u00a0nT. Despite the storm's strength, no power distribution failures were reported. The Bastille Day event was observed by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, thus it is the farthest out in the Solar System that a solar storm has been observed.", "Seventeen major flares erupted on the Sun between 19 October and 5 November 2003, including perhaps the most intense flare ever measured on the GOES XRS sensor\u2014a huge X28 flare, resulting in an extreme radio blackout, on 4 November. These flares were associated with CME events that caused three geomagnetic storms between 29 October and 2 November, during which the second and third storms were initiated before the previous storm period had fully recovered. The minimum Dst values were \u2212151, \u2212353 and \u2212383\u00a0nT. Another storm in this sequence occurred on 4\u20135 November with a minimum Dst of \u221269\u00a0nT. The last geomagnetic storm was weaker than the preceding storms, because the active region on the Sun had rotated beyond the meridian where the central portion CME created during the flare event passed to the side of the Earth. The whole sequence became known as the Halloween Solar Storm. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was offline for approximately 30 hours due to the storm. The Japanese ADEOS-2 satellite was severely damaged and the operation of many other satellites were interrupted due to the storm.Interactions with planetary processes", "The solar wind also carries with it the Sun's magnetic field. This field will have either a North or South orientation. If the solar wind has energetic bursts, contracting and expanding the magnetosphere, or if the solar wind takes a southward polarization, geomagnetic storms can be expected. The southward field causes magnetic reconnection of the dayside magnetopause, rapidly injecting magnetic and particle energy into the Earth's magnetosphere.During a geomagnetic storm, the ionosphere's F2 layer becomes unstable, fragments, and may even disappear. In the northern and southern pole regions of the Earth, auroras are observable.Instruments Magnetometers monitor the auroral zone as well as the equatorial region. Two types of radar, coherent scatter and incoherent scatter, are used to probe the auroral ionosphere. By bouncing signals off ionospheric irregularities, which move with the field lines, one can trace their motion and infer magnetospheric convection.Spacecraft instruments include:", "Magnetometers, usually of the flux gate type. Usually these are at the end of booms, to keep them away from magnetic interference by the spacecraft and its electric circuits. Electric sensors at the ends of opposing booms are used to measure potential differences between separated points, to derive electric fields associated with convection. The method works best at high plasma densities in low Earth orbit; far from Earth long booms are needed, to avoid shielding-out of electric forces. Radio sounders from the ground can bounce radio waves of varying frequency off the ionosphere, and by timing their return determine the electron density profile\u2014up to its peak, past which radio waves no longer return. Radio sounders in low Earth orbit aboard the Canadian Alouette 1 (1962) and Alouette 2 (1965), beamed radio waves earthward and observed the electron density profile of the \"topside ionosphere\". Other radio sounding methods were also tried in the ionosphere (e.g. on IMAGE). Particle detectors include a Geiger counter, as was used for the original observations of the Van Allen radiation belt. Scintillator detectors came later, and still later \"channeltron\" electron multipliers found particularly wide use. To derive charge and mass composition, as well as energies, a variety of mass spectrograph designs were used. For energies up to about 50\u00a0keV (which constitute most of the magnetospheric plasma) time-of-flight spectrometers (e.g. \"top-hat\" design) are widely used.", "Computers have made it possible to bring together decades of isolated magnetic observations and extract average patterns of electrical currents and average responses to interplanetary variations. They also run simulations of the global magnetosphere and its responses, by solving the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on a numerical grid. Appropriate extensions must be added to cover the inner magnetosphere, where magnetic drifts and ionospheric conduction need to be taken into account. So far the results are difficult to interpret, and certain assumptions are needed to cover small-scale phenomena.Geomagnetic storm effectsDisruption of electrical systems It has been suggested that a geomagnetic storm on the scale of the solar storm of 1859 today would cause billions or even trillions of dollars of damage to satellites, power grids and radio communications, and could cause electrical blackouts on a massive scale that might not be repaired for weeks, months, or even years. Such sudden electrical blackouts may threaten food production.Mains electricity grid", "When magnetic fields move about in the vicinity of a conductor such as a wire, a geomagnetically induced current is produced in the conductor. This happens on a grand scale during geomagnetic storms (the same mechanism also influenced telephone and telegraph lines before fiber optics, see above) on all long transmission lines. Long transmission lines (many kilometers in length) are thus subject to damage by this effect. Notably, this chiefly includes operators in China, North America, and Australia, especially in modern high-voltage, low-resistance lines. The European grid consists mainly of shorter transmission circuits, which are less vulnerable to damage.The (nearly direct) currents induced in these lines from geomagnetic storms are harmful to electrical transmission equipment, especially transformers\u2014inducing core saturation, constraining their performance (as well as tripping various safety devices), and causing coils and cores to heat up. In extreme cases, this heat can disable or destroy them, even inducing a chain reaction that can overload transformers. Most generators are connected to the grid via transformers, isolating them from the induced currents on the grid, making them much less susceptible to damage due to geomagnetically induced current. However, a transformer that is subjected to this will act as an unbalanced load to the generator, causing negative sequence current in the stator and consequently rotor heating.", "According to a study by Metatech corporation, a storm with a strength comparable to that of 1921 would destroy more than 300 transformers and leave over 130 million people without power in the United States, costing several trillion dollars. The extent of the disruption is debated, with some congressional testimony indicating a potentially indefinite outage until transformers can be replaced or repaired. These predictions are contradicted by a North American Electric Reliability Corporation report that concludes that a geomagnetic storm would cause temporary grid instability but no widespread destruction of high-voltage transformers. The report points out that the widely quoted Quebec grid collapse was not caused by overheating transformers but by the near-simultaneous tripping of seven relays.Besides the transformers being vulnerable to the effects of a geomagnetic storm, electricity companies can also be affected indirectly by the geomagnetic storm. For instance, internet service providers may go down during geomagnetic storms (and/or remain non-operational long after). Electricity companies may have equipment requiring a working internet connection to function, so during the period the internet service provider is down, the electricity too may not be distributed.", "By receiving geomagnetic storm alerts and warnings (e.g. by the Space Weather Prediction Center; via Space Weather satellites as SOHO or ACE), power companies can minimize damage to power transmission equipment, by momentarily disconnecting transformers or by inducing temporary blackouts. Preventive measures also exist, including preventing the inflow of GICs into the grid through the neutral-to-ground connection.Communications High frequency (3\u201330\u00a0MHz) communication systems use the ionosphere to reflect radio signals over long distances. Ionospheric storms can affect radio communication at all latitudes. Some frequencies are absorbed and others are reflected, leading to rapidly fluctuating signals and unexpected propagation paths. TV and commercial radio stations are little affected by solar activity, but ground-to-air, ship-to-shore, shortwave broadcast and amateur radio (mostly the bands below 30\u00a0MHz) are frequently disrupted. Radio operators using HF bands rely upon solar and geomagnetic alerts to keep their communication circuits up and running.", "Military detection or early warning systems operating in the high frequency range are also affected by solar activity. The over-the-horizon radar bounces signals off the ionosphere to monitor the launch of aircraft and missiles from long distances. During geomagnetic storms, this system can be severely hampered by radio clutter. Also some submarine detection systems use the magnetic signatures of submarines as one input to their locating schemes. Geomagnetic storms can mask and distort these signals.The Federal Aviation Administration routinely receives alerts of solar radio bursts so that they can recognize communication problems and avoid unnecessary maintenance. When an aircraft and a ground station are aligned with the Sun, high levels of noise can occur on air-control radio frequencies. This can also happen on UHF and SHF satellite communications, when an Earth station, a satellite and the Sun are in alignment. In order to prevent unnecessary maintenance on satellite communications systems aboard aircraft AirSatOne provides a live feed for geophysical events from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. AirSatOne's live feed allows users to view observed and predicted space storms. Geophysical Alerts are important to flight crews and maintenance personnel to determine if any upcoming activity or history has or will have an effect on satellite communications, GPS navigation and HF Communications.", "Telegraph lines in the past were affected by geomagnetic storms. Telegraphs used a single long wire for the data line, stretching for many miles, using the ground as the return wire and fed with DC power from a battery; this made them (together with the power lines mentioned below) susceptible to being influenced by the fluctuations caused by the ring current. The voltage/current induced by the geomagnetic storm could have diminished the signal, when subtracted from the battery polarity, or to overly strong and spurious signals when added to it; some operators learned to disconnect the battery and rely on the induced current as their power source. In extreme cases the induced current was so high the coils at the receiving side burst in flames, or the operators received electric shocks. Geomagnetic storms affect also long-haul telephone lines, including undersea cables unless they are fiber optic.Damage to communications satellites can disrupt non-terrestrial telephone, television, radio and Internet links. The National Academy of Sciences reported in 2008 on possible scenarios of widespread disruption in the 2012\u20132013 solar peak. A solar superstorm could cause large-scale global months-long Internet outages. A study describes potential mitigation measures and exceptions \u2013 such as user-powered mesh networks, related peer-to-peer applications and new protocols \u2013 and analyzes the robustness of the current Internet infrastructure.Navigation systems", "The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and other navigation systems such as LORAN and the now-defunct OMEGA are adversely affected when solar activity disrupts their signal propagation. The OMEGA system consisted of eight transmitters located throughout the world. Airplanes and ships used the very low frequency signals from these transmitters to determine their positions. During solar events and geomagnetic storms, the system gave navigators information that was inaccurate by as much as several miles. If navigators had been alerted that a proton event or geomagnetic storm was in progress, they could have switched to a backup system.GNSS signals are affected when solar activity causes sudden variations in the density of the ionosphere, causing the satellite signals to scintillate (like a twinkling star). The scintillation of satellite signals during ionospheric disturbances is studied at HAARP during ionospheric modification experiments. It has also been studied at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory.One technology used to allow GPS receivers to continue to operate in the presence of some confusing signals is Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). However, RAIM is predicated on the assumption that a majority of the GPS constellation is operating properly, and so it is much less useful when the entire constellation is perturbed by global influences such as geomagnetic storms. Even if RAIM detects a loss of integrity in these cases, it may not be able to provide a useful, reliable signal.", "Satellite hardware damage Geomagnetic storms and increased solar ultraviolet emission heat Earth's upper atmosphere, causing it to expand. The heated air rises, and the density at the orbit of satellites up to about  increases significantly. This results in increased drag, causing satellites to slow and change orbit slightly. Low Earth orbit satellites that are not repeatedly boosted to higher orbits slowly fall and eventually burn up. Skylab's 1979 destruction is an example of a spacecraft reentering Earth's atmosphere prematurely as a result of higher-than-expected solar activity. During the great geomagnetic storm of March 1989, four of the U.S. Navy's navigational satellites had to be taken out of service for up to a week, the U.S. Space Command had to post new orbital elements for over 1000 objects affected, and the Solar Maximum Mission satellite fell out of orbit in December the same year.The vulnerability of the satellites depends on their position as well. The South Atlantic Anomaly is a perilous place for a satellite to pass through, due to the unusually weak geomagnetic field at low Earth orbit.Pipelines Rapidly fluctuating geomagnetic fields can produce geomagnetically induced currents in pipelines. This can cause multiple problems for pipeline engineers. Pipeline flow meters can transmit erroneous flow information and the corrosion rate of the pipeline can be dramatically increased.Radiation hazards to humans", "Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere allow adequate protection at ground level, but astronauts are subject to potentially lethal radiation poisoning. The penetration of high-energy particles into living cells can cause chromosome damage, cancer and other health problems. Large doses can be immediately fatal. Solar protons with energies greater than 30\u00a0MeV are particularly hazardous.Solar proton events can also produce elevated radiation aboard aircraft flying at high altitudes. Although these risks are small, flight crews may be exposed repeatedly, and monitoring of solar proton events by satellite instrumentation allows exposure to be monitored and evaluated, and eventually flight paths and altitudes to be adjusted to lower the absorbed dose.Ground level enhancements, also known as ground level events or GLEs, occur when a solar particle event contains particles with sufficient energy to have effects at ground level, mainly detected as an increase in the number of neutrons measured at ground level. These events have been shown to have an impact on radiation dosage, but they do not significantly increase the risk of cancer.Effect on animalsScientists are still studying whether or not animals are affected, some suggesting solar storms induce whales to beach themselves. Some have speculated that migrating animals which use magnetoreception to navigate, such as birds and honey bees, might also be affected.See alsoReferencesFurther reading", "Carlowicz, M., and R.

The council voted to unite the existing Ukrainian Eastern Orthodox churches (the UOC-KP, the UAOC and parts of the UOC-MP) through their representatives, on the basis of complete canonical independence. All the members of the UOC-KP and the UAOC, and two members of the UOC-MP, merged into the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the unification council elected Epiphanius I as its first primate.HistoryThree Eastern Orthodox churches in Ukraine Since the end of the 20th century, three Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions have existed in Ukraine.", "The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) (UOC-MP) which is part of the Russian Orthodox Church and thus under the Moscow Patriarchate. This church was, until 11 October 2018, the only Orthodox church in Ukraine recognized by other Orthodox churches. The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC), led by Metropolitan Makariy, which was independent, having been founded in 1921 following the establishment of the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic and having survived the Soviet Union both outside and inside the country.", "The Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP), led by Patriarch Filaret of Kyiv, an independent church which was founded in July 1992. In January 1992, after Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union following its dissolution, Metropolitan of Kyiv Filaret of the UOC-MP convened an assembly at the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra that adopted a request for autocephaly to the Moscow Patriarch. The Patriarchate of Moscow did not comply and asked Filaret to resign. Filaret did not resign and was suspended on 27 May 1992 by the UOC-MP. The bishops loyal to Metropolitan Filaret and a similar group from the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church organized a unifying synod which was held on 25\u201326 June 1992. The delegates agreed to form a combined church named the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate under a patriarch they elected, Mstyslav of the UAOC. Mstyslav never approved the union between the UAOC and the UOC-KP.  Filaret was defrocked on 11 July 1992 by the Russian Orthodox Church. After the death of Patriarch Mstyslav in 1993, the UOC-KP was headed by Patriarch Volodymyr. In July 1995, upon the death of Volodymyr, Filaret was elected head of the UOC-KP by a vote of 160-5. Filaret was anathematized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1997.", "The UAOC and the UOC-KP were not recognized by other Orthodox churches and were considered schismatic. ROC officials stated that the anathematization of Filaret was \"recognized by all the Local Orthodox Churches including the Church of Constantinople\". The synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate did indeed recognize, in a July 1992 letter to Patriarch Alexy II, the defrocking of Filaret by the ROC,  and the Ecumenical Patriarch recognized the anathematization of Filaret in a letter of April 1997 to Patriarch Alexy II.Previous attempts at unification In 2002, Filaret Denisenko said: \"The Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyivan Patriarchate [UOC-KP] and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church [UAOC], are not separated in faith, by position as to church canons, by their views on building up the Ukrainian state. Therefore, as we have no disagreements between us\".In October 2009 Bishop Makariy (Maletych) formulated the idea of a single local Ukrainian church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate's jurisdiction, which would be the result of the union between the UAOC and the UOC-KP. At that time Makariy had not yet become the head of the UAOC. Patriarch Filaret, the head of the UOC-KP, expressed support for the idea of a united autocephalous Ukrainian church in October 2011.", "Preparations for unification of the UAOC and the UOC-KP took place in 2011 between the episcopates of both churches. In the end, the unification council between the two churches, which was scheduled to take place on 14 September 2015 between the UAOC and the UOC-KP, never took place as both churches could not agree on the future statutes of a united Ukrainian church. This unification attempt therefore failed, Makariy blamed this failure on Philaret's inability to negotiate. Before this, according to Filaret in 2015, the UAOC and the UOC-KP already had had four attempts at negotiations in the previous 20 years, the 2015 negotiation being the fifth. On 14 December 2018, Makariy declared in an interview to the channel NEWSONE that the UOC-KP and the UAOC could have been united \"years ago\" and blamed the UOC-KP for the fact that this union never happened.After the October 2018 decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate", "Following the 11 October 2018 decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate to lift the excommunication of the UOC-KP and the UAOC and to grant autocephaly to Ukraine, preparations began for a unification council to institute an autocephalous Ukrainian church that would unite the UOC-KP, the UAOC, and those members of the UOC-MP who were willing to join. The date of this unification council was not set at that stage and, according to Filaret Denisenko, was up to the Patriarch of Constantinople to decide but he said he hoped that thanks to his church's efforts this council could take place before the end of 2018. Filaret said that the issue of jurisdictional affiliation of parishes would be decided by vote of the congregation of each parish. It was believed that a united Ukrainian church was a compulsory step before Ukraine could be granted the Tomos (formal decree) of autocephaly from the Patriarch of Constantinople.", "On 12 October 2018, the UOC-KP communicated that the 11 October decision by the Ecumenical Patriarchate had restored the canonical recognition of the episcopate and clergy of the Kyiv Patriarchate. However, it was later clarified that Filaret was considered by the Ecumenical Patriarchate only as \"the former metropolitan of Kyiv\", and Makariy as \"the former Archbishop of Lviv\" and, on 2 November, that the Ecumenical Patriarchate did not recognize either the UAOC or the UOC-KP as legitimate and that their respective leaders were not recognized as primates of their churches. The Ecumenical Patriarchate declared that it recognized the sacraments performed by the UOC-KP and the UAOC as valid. The 11 October 2018 decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate was viewed as a key step towards those two organizations merging into a single church independent from Moscow. The Russian Orthodox Church is linked to 12,000 parishes in Ukraine while the Kyiv Patriarchate and UAOC had about 6,000; however, it was believed that many of the Russian-controlled Ukrainian parishes may defect to the Kyiv organizations.According to Filaret, he would undoubtedly be the winner in case of an election of the leader of a united Ukrainian Church \"because Moscow will do everything to destroy the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. And therefore, in order to preserve the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and brring [sic] the cause to the end, [he] ha[s] to work to the end\". Filaret declared he was ready to take the role of head of a united Ukrainian Church.", "On 20 October 2018, in an interview with Espreso TV, the head of the UAOC, Makariy, declared that there was no negotiations in the direction of a united Ukrainian church and that after his last meeting with Filaret, at which Filaret said that only his statute would be used, Makariy began to question the success of the union. On 27 October Makariy told Zik TV he would not nominate his candidacy during the future council and would instead \"support the one to be offered by the Ecumenical Patriarch\".In an interview to the BBC on 2 November, Archbishop Job of the Ecumenical Patriarchate declared the united Ukrainian Church would be called \"the Orthodox Church in Ukraine\". However, Filaret, head of the UOC-KP, declared on 2 November to Radio Liberty that the united Ukrainian church would be called \"Ukrainian Orthodox Church\" with \"Kyiv Patriarchate\" as the church's second name.On 3 November 2018, Ukrainian President Poroshenko, in visit in Turkey, signed a cooperation agreement with the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. According to Poroshenko, this agreement \"creates all the conditions for the preparation process for a unification assembly and the process of providing a tomos to be brought into clear correspondence with the canons of the Orthodox Church.\" This agreement led to protests by hierarchs of the UOC-MP and the ROC. The text of the agreement was later released on 12 March 2019.", "On 10 November, the website Vesti-Ukr allegedly revealed the heads of the UAOC and the UOC-KP, respectively Makariy and Filaret, had individually sent a letter to the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Makariy declared the same thing as in his interview to Zik TV: that he would not run for the position of head of the united Ukrainian Orthodox church. The real surprise was the fact that Filaret also declared he accepted not to run for this position either. In the letter attributed to Filaret, Filaret allegedly asked the Ecumenical Patriarch to support the election of the member of the UOC-KP Epiphany (Dumenko), currently officing as \"Metropolitan\" and \"patriarchal deputy\" in the UOC-KP and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Filaret, as head of the united Ukrainian Orthodox church. On 16 November, Filaret's supposed letter was published by ZNAJ.ua; in this supposed letter, Filaret allegedly declares that he withdrew his candidacy at the request of the Ecumenical Patriarch.", "On 13 November, at the initiative of President Poroshenko, a meeting between the episcopate of UOC-MP and President Poroshenko was scheduled to take place in Kyiv. The UOC-MP refused to meet Poroshenko at the Ukrainian House, preferring to meet Poroshenko at the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra of the UOC-MP, and immediately notified Poroshenko of it; Poroshenko refused to hold the meeting at the Pechersk Lavra, preferring to meet members of the UOC-MP at the Ukrainian House. The same day, the UOC-MP issued an official statement in which the UOC-MP confirmed \"its readiness to meet with the President of Ukraine, but on church territory.\" Nevertheless, in the evening, some representatives of the Council arrived at the Ukrainian House and met with Poroshenko. According to a BBC source from the president's administration, their number did not exceed 10 people, but they represented a much larger number of UOC-MP hierarchs supporting the creation of an autocephalous church. According to other sources, two metropolitans and the archbishop were present at the meeting with Poroshenko. In addition, Metropolitan Simeon of the UOC-MP had the letter of attorney to participate in a meeting with the president from 15 hierarchs of the UOC-MP. It was assumed that the voting of the hierarchs of the UOC-MP at the planned Council of the \"Orthodox Local Church of Ukraine\" will be carried out in a similar way (by the letter of attorney). On 14 November, some information concerning the meeting were revealed by Ukrainian President advisor", "Rostyslav Pavlenko.", "On 14 November, GolosUA reported that on 15 November  of the Ecumenical Patriarchate would come to Ukraine in order to organize the future unification council, he would also be the one leading said council. Allegedly, still according to GolosUA, the unification council would take place on 22 November 2018 and at that time the statute of the united Orthodox church of Ukraine and the text of the Tomos on autocephaly would be ready. The UOC-KP officially denied that the unification council's date had been officially released. On 15 November, UNN reported that Metropolitan Emmanuel had arrived in Kyiv to prepare the unification process; UNN also reported the unification council would allegedly take place on 22 November 2018.", "On 19 November, the Ecumenical Patriarchate issued an official communiqu\u00e9, stating that it \"reiterates its sacred decision to grant the Tomos of Autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine\" and that the date for the Ukrainian unification council \"will be presented within December 2018\" by the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. On the same day, Filaret issued an official communiqu\u00e9 \"[i]n connection with the proliferation of a number of publications whose explicit purpose is to sow confusion in the Ukrainian Church and in society\" In said communiqu\u00e9 he declared: \"Self-nomination for candidacy in the Church is not allowed by the canons. Earlier it was reported that the bishops of the UOC-Kyiv Patriarchate would offer my candidacy for election as the Primate. I thank the bishops for expressing my trust in me, as well as thanking for the strong support from the fullness of the Kyiv Patriarchate and the whole society.\" He added that if he was chosen as candidate by the UOC-KP, he would inform the council of the UOC-KP of his decision and explain it.The publication Levyy Bereg cited sources of ecclesiastical circles saying that the probable date of the unification council would be on December 9\u201310.", "President Poroshenko declared on 23 November that the decision on the approval of the tomos to Ukraine should be taken on November 27\u201329 during the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and that Rostyslav Pavlenko, presidential advisor, would go to Istanbul to attend at the synod. Rostyslav Pavlenko went to Istanbul and 26 November, before the Synod, he was received by the Ecumenical Patriarch and had a conversation with him concerning \"events in Ukraine and final steps toward the granting of the tomos of autocephaly (full independence) of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine\". On 27 November Pavlenko told Interfax-Ukraine that the Ecumenical Patriarchate's communiqu\u00e9 concerning the granting of the tomos and the date of the unification council should be issued on 29 November. He said that at the unification council \"the primate of this [united Ukrainian] Church will be elected, and he will go to Istanbul to receive [the Tomos]\", he added that the arrival of the Ecumenical Patriarch in Kyiv was \"not scheduled.\"29 November 2018 communiqu\u00e9 of the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate The regular November session of the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate started on 27 November and ended on 29 November, lasting three days.On 29 November, the synod ended. Some like the Religious Information Service of Ukraine had expected the Ecumenical Patriarchate to give the date of the unification council of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. However, no date was given.", "After the end of its synod, the Ecumenical Patriarchate later released, on its official website, an official communiqu\u00e9. In said communiqu\u00e9, the Ecumenical Patriarchate announced: 1) that the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate had decided to dissolve the AROCWE, \"thereby entrusting its faithful to the Hierarchs of the Ecumenical Throne in Europe\", 2) that, in anticipation of the granting of the Tomos of autocephaly to the Orthodox church of Ukraine, the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate had \"drafted the Ukrainian Church's Constitutional Charter.\" On the same day, President Poroshenko said in an official speech to the Ukrainian nation that the date for the unification council for the Ukrainian church would be announced \"soon\" by the Ecumenical Patriarch.On 3 December, parliament speaker Andriy Parubiy said the Ecumenical Patriarchate had approved the date of the unification council and that this council would be held in Kyiv, but Parubiy did not say on which date this council would be held.On 4 December, the Greek website ROMFEA published the first page of the draft statute of the autocephalous church in Ukraine.", "Disapprobation by the UOC-MP On 13 November, the synod of the UOC-MP (an autonomous church of the Moscow Patriarchate) officially declared in a resolution that they considered the 11 October declaration of the Ecumenical Patriarchate \"invalid\" and canonically \"null and void\", and that the communion between the UOC-MP and the Ecumenical Patriarchate \"is deemed impossible at present and thereby ceases\". Two bishops of the UOC-MP did not sign the resolution, one of them being Metropolitan Simeon of Vinnytsia and Bar.", "In an interview given on 14 November to the Vinnytsia Press Club, Metropolitan Simeon of Vinnytsia and Bar of the UOC-MP said he did not sign the UOC-MP resolution as he disagreed with some statements in the resolution and considered this resolution as \"bad\". He also said he would participate in the unification council. On 15 November, most of the clergy of Vinnytsia of the UOC-MP met in emergency, spontaneously and without the prior consent of its hierarchy. Most of the clergy of Vinnytsia publicly expressed its support to the 13 November resolution of the UOC-MP, and made an appeal to Metropolitan Simeon to ask him to hold a general meeting of the Vinnytsia eparchy. On 17 November, in a sermon, Metropolitan Simeon clarified that his refusal was his own decision, because, he stated, \"not a single bishop represented the opinion of his eparchy or people at the Council, everyone spoke for themselves\". On 20 November, an official monthly general meeting of the Vinnytsia eparchy chaired by Metropolitan Simeon was held; the Eparchial Council \"categorically condemned the unauthorized assemblies held in the Vinnytsia eparchy\" and \"stated that the Resolution of the Bishops\u2019 Council of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, taken on November 13, 2018, is a document binding on all bishops, clergy and laity of the UOC and confirmed its readiness to comply with the Resolution by the entire Vinnytsia eparchy.\"", "On 16 November 2018 Metropolitan  of Cherkasy and Kaniv in his interview to BBC expressed his support for the creation of an autocephalous Church in Ukraine. He also said that he was going to participate in the unification council, and perhaps he would join the new autocephalous Church.On 20 November 2018, chancellor of the UOC-MP, Metropolitan Anthony of Boryspil and Brovary, declared in an interview that \"[s]anctions will be applied to the members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church [of the Moscow Patriarchate] who participate in the 'Unification Council.On 7 December, the UOC-MP synod declared the unification council conveyed by the Ecumenical Pariarchate as unlawful. On the same day, Metropolitan Onufriy decided not to answer the Ecumenical Patriarchate's invitation to the unification council and sent back to the Ecumenical Patriariarch the letter of convocation he had received.Unification council", "Convocation of the council On 5 December, President Poroshenko declared the unification council would be held on 15 December. BBC News reported that the council would last one day and that, according to sources in Constantinople, said council would effectively be held on 15 December. On the same day, Archbishop Clement, head of the UOC-MP, declared that the UOC-MP would not participate in this unification council. Also on 5 December, counselor of Poroshencko, Rostislav Pavlenko, declared that the \"Ukrainian Autocephalous church will be completely independent and equal amongst other canonically recognized Orthodox churches\". He added: \"The Ukrainian Church will be introduced into the diptych, that is, the list of independent Churches. She will become one of the fifteen, already fifteenth, universally recognized, independent Churches. And in this there is a fundamental difference\". He also said the charter of the united Ukrainian Orthodox church would be approved by the bishops present at the unification council. Still on 5 December, Archbishop Herman of Chernivtsi and Khotyn of the UAOC said no candidate for the position of primate of the future united Ukrainian Orthodox church will be submitted by the UAOC.", "On 6 December, the website ROMFEA published the letter of convocation to the unification council which was sent to the Orthodox hierarchs of Ukraine. This letter contained a convocation to the unification council with the procedure of election of the primate of the future church. The letter said that any bishop can bring with him a priest and either a monk or a member of the laity to the unification council, and that the monks/priest/laypersons brought this way, as well as the bishops, would have the right to vote during the council for the elaboration of the charter of the new church and the election of its primate. The vote will be secret and by ballot. Moreover, the President Poroshenko would be an observer during the council. On the same day, Metropolitan Alexander of Pereyaslav-Khmelnytskyi and Vishnevsky (ru) published on his Facebook page a letter, in Greek, sent by the Ecumenical Patriarchate to Metropolitan Onuphriy; Alexander also gave an unofficial Ukrainian translation of said letter in his post. In the letter to Onuphriy, the Ecumenical Patriarchate declared it still allowed him to be bishop \"in a form of oikonomia and condescension\" but that if he refused to take part in the unification council he would cease to be the Metropolitan of Kyiv. The letter to Onuphriy was published on 7 December, in Greek, on the Greek website ROMFEA.", "Position of the UOC-KP On 6 December 2018, the press secretary of the UOC-KP, Archbishop , in response to the allegations of a religious expert who claimed that Filaret Denisenko would not run for the post of primate of the unified Ukrainian church, wrote on his Facebook page that on 19 November Filaret had already expressed his official position. In the same post, he linked to the previous official statement made on 19 November. Still on 6 December, the UOC-KP held a synod. The synod ended the same day and issued a communiqu\u00e9. Among the decisions taken by the synod, one was to support the 19 November statement of Filaret. The communiqu\u00e9 also mentioned the UOC-KP would elect its candidate for the post of primate of the united Ukrainian church on 13 December 2018, two days before the unification council; the communiqu\u00e9 also mentioned that considering all the circumstances, the UOC-KP \"is ready, if necessary, to postpone for some time the request to recognize it in a dignity of patriarchate, retaining that name within its boundaries and for domestic use\". The council of the UOC-KP also decided that only the hierarchs (bishops) would have the right to vote during the unification council and that the vote be open and public. The UOC-KP synod's last two demands\u00a0\u2013 that the voters of the unification council be only bishops, and that the vote to elect the new church's primate be open (not secret)\u00a0\u2013 were contrary to those previously specified by the Ecumenical Patriarchate in its letter.", "On 7 December, Filaret Denisenko said,  is spreading rumors that the patriarch will resign and will not run. This is not true. I will be patriarch to death, because the enthronement was in 1995. And no one will remove this grace\" and that during the unification council the UOC-KP will \"reject everything inappropriate if it is demanded from us\".In early December, Metropolitan Sophroniy Dmitruk of the UOC-MP, who was viewed as being in favor of autocephaly, said in an interview that if Filaret was elected by the unification council next to no one of the UOC-MP would join the new church.According to the Russian news agency Vesti, on 8 December 2018 presidential advisor Rostislav Pavlenko met with Filaret and three of Filaret's bishops behind closed doors. It remains unknown what they were talking about behind closed doors.On 10 December, Filaret said the UOC-KP might not participate at the unification council because of the disagreement with the Ecumenical Patriarchate concerning the procedure of vote of said council. The same day, the press secretary of the UOC-KP, Zorya, issued an official communiqu\u00e9 which states that \"[t]he fact that the Kyiv Patriarchate has proposals as for the procedure of the Council or the election of the church's head does not mean that a common vision will not be agreed in the end\".", "On 11 December, Makariy Maletych, head of the UAOC, said the UAOC would come to the unification council at the invitation of the Ecumenical Patriarch. He also responded to the UOC-KP's previous decisions by saying: \"How can the council be the Council of Bishops, if one priest and one layman with a bishop are invited?\"On 12 December, in an interview given to the BBC, Zorya said that if the UOC-KP took part in the unification council, it  really get something bigger and better than now\". He added that if the UOC-KP did not take part in the unification council their situation would worsen and their parishes would leave the UOC-KP. He explained: \"If we want to achieve success, we must deal with the real situation, rather than the ideal one, which we'd like to have.\"", "Acceptation of Constantinople's terms On 13 December, as planned on 6 December, all bishops of the UOC-KP held a council chaired by Filaret. This council of the UOC-KP decided that the UOC-KP would participate in the unification council and allow representatives of the clergy, laity and monks to vote, according to the directives of the Ecumenical Patriarch. Press secretary of the UOC-KP, Zorya, declared the same day in an interview to BBC Ukraine that, during said council, the UOC-KP had elected its only candidate for the unification council but that his identity was secret, and that the tomos would be given on 6 January 2019 by the Ecumenical Patriarch to the elected primate of the new united Ukrainian church. He also added that each of the UOC-KP bishops are expected to bring one priest and one monk or layman to the unification council, and that the vote during the unification council would be secret.Beginning of the unification council On 12 December,  of the Ecumenical Patriarchate arrived in Kyiv to prepare the unification council. A letter of invitation to the unification council had been sent to every bishop of the UOC-KP, of the UAOC, and of the UOC-MP. As of 13 December, out of the 97 bishops of the UOC-MP, 56 had returned the invitation for the unification council they had received.", "On 14 December, Makariy, head of the UAOC, declared in an interview to Radio Liberty that at the demand of the Ecumenical Patriarch he (Makariy) would not run for the post of head of the new united Ukrainian church. Makariy added that he believed the Ecumenical Patriarch had demanded the same thing to Filaret, head of the UOC-KP. On the same day,  and Metropolitan Simeon, both of the UOC-MP, received a letter from the Ecumenical Patriarchate which absolved them of any sanction imposed by any church.", "On 15 December, the unification council took place at St. Sophia's Cathedral in Kyiv, with thousands people waiting outside the cathedral, in the St Sofia Square. The same day, the Ukrainian website Pravda published online the alleged project of charter of the united Ukrainian church, however this version was the one the Ecumenical Patriarchate had drafted during its 29 November 2018 synod and did not contain the additions which had been made thereafter at the request of the UAOC and the UOC-KP. During the council, the Ukrainian President Poroshenko made a speech to the participants of the unification council. At the council, Filaret appeared with the headgear of a Metropolitan and indicated he recognized the Ecumenical Patriarch's authority over the new church which would be created. Filaret later added that he had not put his patriarchal headgear at the request of Metropolitan Emmanuel of France who chaired the council. Metropolitan Emmanuel justified his demand by \"explaining in such a way\" that Filaret was \"not a patriarch for them [the Ecumenical Patriarchate].\" Filaret added: \"And since the Council was under [Metropolitan Emmanuel's] leadership, they explained that there could not be a patriarch at the Council\". Filaret added all the bishops at the council acted as bishops of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.", "According to , President Poroshenko had promised Patriarch Bartholomew the participation of 10-15 bishops of the UOC-MP at the council, but only two members of the UOC-MP took part in it: Metropolitan Simeon of Vinnitsa and Bar and Metropolitan-vicar . The ROC had called its bishops to boycott the unification council. According to Archimandrite  of the UOC-MP, in spring 2018 ten hierarchs of the UOC-MP supported the idea of an autocephalous Ukrainian church. According to the exarch of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Ukraine, , during his four months as exarchs in Ukraine he met 18 hierarchs of the UOC-MP and all of them were ready to join a local Ukrainian church.Dissolution of the UOC-KP and the UAOC On 15 December, before the unification council started, the UOC-KP and the UAOC held separate meetings during which they both dissolved themselves, which delayed the beginning of the unification council.", "Orthodoxie.com gives the following description of the events of the unification council: the council started three hours late because 10-12 bishops of the UOC-MP had been brought to Kyiv by the SBU and forced to sign letters containing their vote for Metropolitan Simeon; however, when Met. Simeon presented the letters to the representatives of the Ecumenical Patriarchate at the council, the representatives demanded that those bishops be presents in person at the council to vote, which caused a three-hour delay. The council then started. The Ecumenical Patriarchate demanded that Metropolitan Simeon be elected by the council, and asked President Poroshenko to make pressure on the voters in order for Met. Simeon to be elected, which Poroshenko did. However, members of the UOC-KP had their own candidate who was faithful to Filaret, which caused another delay.Archimandrite and doctor in theology  of the UOC-MP said two bishops of the UOC-MP were present, Simeon and , and that those bishops \"brought with them written requests which delegated to them the right to vote on behalf of other bishops who were not present. There was a discussion at the Council whether it was possible to accept these votes in absentia, and it was decided that it was impossible. Those votes were not counted.\"", "On 18 December, , of the now dissolved UOC-KP, declared in a press conference that he had been forced by Filaret to withdraw his candidacy from the unification council. According to Mykhail, Filaret said that if the UOC-KP was to nominate two candidate, both of those candidates might lose the election at the unification council. Filaret therefore threatened that if Mykhail did not withdrew his candidacy before going to the unification council, Filaret would not sign the paper of the dissolution of the UOC-KP and Filaret would not go to the unification council. In the end, Mykhail withdrew his candidacy as he perceived this decision was the best for the OCU. On 16 December, a similar account had been given by a member of the diocese of Mykhail, deputy Mykola Buliga, who participated in the unification council as a laity. According to Buliga, it is this disagreement between Filaret and Mykhail which made the council start more than three hours late. Moreover, Buliga claims that President Poroshenko was pressured by Filaret to support Epiphany during the council, and Poroshenko pressured the voters in order for them to vote for Epiphany. Buliga indicated that Mykhail was the favorite and that even after the withdrawal of his candidacy, Mykhail still got 30 votes.", "Mikhayl's withdrawal of candidacy was allegedly done after an intervention by Filaret. According to BBC Ukraine, Metropolitan Mykhail of Lutsk and Volyn withdrew his candidacy during the council before the final vote, which allowed Epiphany to win against Metropolitan Simeon by 20 votes.Filaret later denied Mykhail was blackmailed to withdraw his candidacy, saying Mykhail was only \"persuaded\" to withdraw his candidacy  order to maintain unity\". He also explained in an interview that \"the enemy forces simply took advantage of his [Mykhail] desire to be the head of the Ukrainian Church. If it were not for the forces that supported him, he would not have nominated his candidacy.\"Vote There were 192 or 200 voters in total. 42 of them were bishops of the UOC-KP, 12 were bishops of the UAOC and at least 2 were bishops of the UOC-MP; how many bishops of the UOC-MP participated remains unclear, 10 bishops of the UOC-MP were planned to participate. Every bishop was to bring two people to vote; the UOC-KP's total of electors was planned to be 126, the UAOC's total of electors was planned to be 36 delegates, and the UOC-MP's total of electors was planned to be 30.In the second round, laity and priests did not vote, only bishops.According to Interfax, some of the UOC-KP bishops had their own candidate for the council:  who would be candidate for the unification council. According to Unian, said Mykhail was supported by a minority of bishops of the UOC-KP.", "According to religious expert , the vote went as follow. Mykhail, Epiphany and Simeon were the three candidates at the post of head of the OCU. In the first round, the score of the three candidates was: Mykhail: 38; Simeon: 56; Epiphany: 81. Allegedly, at the end, Mikhail dismissed his candidacy. According to Sagan, the votes of bishops were as follows: Simeon: 28; Epiphany: 36. Still according to Sagan, the vote was secret during both rounds. According to Orthodoxia.info, Mykhail supporters' votes went to Epiphany after Mykhail withdrew his candidacy.According to archbishop  who was part of the UOC-KP, the charter of the united church was adopted with an overwhelming majority (only one voter was against).Election of Metropolitan Epiphanius", "Metropolitan Epiphanius of the UOC-KP, who had been chosen on 13 December by the UOC-KP as its only candidate, and was considered Filaret's right arm and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was elected Metropolitan of Kyiv and all Ukraine by the unification council on 15 December 2018 after the second round of voting. In his speech to the faithfuls after the election, Metropolitan Epiphany thanked President Poroshenko as well as Filaret, and said Filaret was \"the spiritual father of all Ukrainians\" and \"will continue to be an active life-long [mentor], helping us to jointly build our united local Ukrainian Orthodox church\". Epiphany also said no weighty decision would be taken by his church as long as he had not received the church's tomos. The unification council also adopted a charter for the newly formed church.The Ecumenical Patriarch congratulated and blessed the newly elected Metropolitan on the day of his election and said the newly elected primate was invited to come to Istanbul to concelebrate a mass with the Ecumenical Patriarch and receive the Orthodox Church of Ukraine's tomos on 6 January 2019. On the next day after the election of Epiphany, a Sunday, the Ecumenical Patriarch commemorated him during a mass, along with the other primates of the other Orthodox churches.", "After the council, Filaret became the \"honorary patriarch\" of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and will serve in the St Volodymyr's Cathedral. On 16 December 2018, during a mass in which he came wearing the headgear of a patriarch, during his sermon, Filaret declared he was still patriarch: \"The Patriarch remains for life and, together with the Primate, governs the Ukrainian Orthodox Church\". After the mass, he was acclaimed by the hierarchs of the church as \"great vladyka and father Filaret, the holiest patriarch of Kyiv and all Ukraine-Rus and sacred archimandrite of the Holy Dormition Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra\". On 22 December 2018, Filaret declared that if he had run for the role of primate of the OCU, Ukraine would never have got a tomos. On 20 January 2019, Filaret declared concerning Epiphany: \"I supported him and fought for his candidacy, because among all the young bishops I see him as the most worthy to be the primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.\"", "Concerning his election, Metropolitan Epiphanius later declared: \"I always relied on the will of God. In 2013, I introduced my candidacy to the post of patriarchal governor, and the Bishops' synod appointed me. In the event of the death of the patriarch, the governor became a locum tenens. On his shoulder was the responsibility of the church and the election of a new primate. Since that time, among the bishops and the clergy, the idea that I can be a candidate for the head of the Local Church was confirmed. I did not want this. There are many older hierarchs who have more experience. But so, the Lord blessed me to choose my candidacy. For me it's a heavy cross. But we live in historical time.\"Conflict between Filaret and Epiphanius Filaret later explained in an appeal the conditions of the council. According to Filaret, the agreement reached at the unification council was as follow: \"the primate is responsible for the external representation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), and the patriarch is responsible for the internal church life in Ukraine, but in cooperation with the primate. The primate shall do nothing in the church without the consent of the patriarch. The patriarch chairs the meetings of the Holy Synod and the UOC meetings for the sake of preserving unity, its growth, and affirmation.\" Filaret considers this agreement has not been fulfilled.", "Filaret also said he was asked by the Ecumenical Patriarch not to put forward his (Filaret) candidacy at the council, and that  asked him not to wear the koukoulion; Filaret was also asked to nominate any bishop for the post of primate; Filaret agreed to those demands and said he chose \"humiliation\" in order for the church to get the tomos. Filaret also said that giving up the status of patriarchate was a demand of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in order for the Ecumenical Patriarchate to grant a tomos to a Metropolis which was part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Filaret said that therefore \"giving up on the status of patriarchy was purely situational. Only the Local Council of the church, which created the Kyiv Patriarchate, may cancel the decision to establish the Kyiv Patriarchate. No such council has been convened. This means the Kyiv Patriarchate remains in place and continues to operate, especially since it is registered with state bodies.\" He justified himself saying that during the 15 December 2018 unification council, they \"gave up on the status of Patriarchate\" but that the council \"was not a council of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Church, but the one of the Kyiv Metropolis of the Patriarchate of Constantinople\".On 14 August 2019, the UAOC legally ceased to exist because its legal entity merged with the legal entity of the OCU.", "On 14 December 2019, after the meeting of the enlarged Bishops' Council, held on December 14 in Kyiv on the occasion of the anniversary of the creation of the OCU, Epiphanius declared that the procedure of liquidation of the UAOC as well as the UOC-KP had been completed the day before. He added: \"Such structures no longer exist.

{"put": "id:en:doc::doc-en-817650", "fields": {"id": "doc-en-817650", "text": ["Edwin Howard Armstrong (December 18, 1890 \u2013 February 1, 1954) was an American electrical engineer and inventor, who developed FM (frequency modulation) radio and the superheterodyne receiver system. He held 42 patents and received numerous awards, including the first Medal of Honor awarded by the Institute of Radio Engineers (now IEEE), the French Legion of Honor, the 1941 Franklin Medal and the 1942 Edison Medal. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and included in the International Telecommunication Union's roster of great inventors.Early lifeArmstrong was born in the Chelsea district of New York City, the oldest of John and Emily  (n\u00e9e Smith) Armstrong's three children. His father began working at a young age at the American branch of the Oxford University Press, which published bibles and standard classical works, eventually advancing to the position of vice president. His parents first met at the North Presbyterian Church, located at 31st Street and Ninth Avenue. His mother's family had strong ties to Chelsea, and an active role in church functions. When the church moved north, the Smiths and Armstrongs followed, and in 1895 the Armstrong family moved from their brownstone row house at 347 West 29th Street to a similar house at 26 West 97th Street in the Upper West Side. The family was comfortably middle class.", "At the age of eight, Armstrong contracted Sydenham's chorea (then known as St. Vitus' Dance), an infrequent but serious neurological disorder precipitated by rheumatic fever. For the rest of his life, Armstrong was afflicted with a physical tic exacerbated by excitement or stress. Due to this illness, he withdrew from public school and was home-tutored for two years. To improve his health, the Armstrong family moved to a house overlooking the Hudson River, at 1032 Warburton Avenue in Yonkers. The Smith family subsequently moved next door. Armstrong's tic and the time missed from school led him to become socially withdrawn.From an early age, Armstrong showed an interest in electrical and mechanical devices, particularly trains. He loved heights and constructed a makeshift backyard antenna tower that included a bosun's chair for hoisting himself up and down its length, to the concern of neighbors. Much of his early research was conducted in the attic of his parents' house.", "In 1909, Armstrong enrolled at Columbia University in New York City, where he became a member of the Epsilon Chapter of the Theta Xi engineering fraternity, and studied under Professor Michael Pupin at the Hartley Laboratories, a separate research unit at Columbia. Another of his instructors, Professor John H. Morecroft, later remembered Armstrong as being intensely focused on the topics that interested him, but somewhat indifferent to the rest of his studies. Armstrong challenged conventional wisdom and was quick to question the opinions of both professors and peers. In one case, he recounted how he tricked an instructor he disliked into receiving a severe electrical shock. He also stressed the practical over the theoretical, stating that progress was more likely the product of experimentation and reasoning than on mathematical calculation and the formulae of \"mathematical physics\".Armstrong graduated from Columbia in 1913, earning an electrical engineering degree.During World War I, Armstrong served in the Signal Corps as a captain and later a major.Following college graduation, he received a $600 one-year appointment as a laboratory assistant at Columbia, after which he nominally worked as a research assistant, for a salary of $1 a year, under Professor Pupin. Unlike most engineers, Armstrong never became a corporate employee. He set up a self-financed independent research and development laboratory at Columbia, and owned his patents outright.", "In 1934, he filled the vacancy left by John H. Morecroft's death, receiving an appointment as a Professor of Electrical Engineering at Columbia, a position he held the remainder of his life.Early workRegenerative circuitArmstrong began working on his first major invention while still an undergraduate at Columbia. In late 1906, Lee de Forest had invented the three-element (triode) \"grid Audion\" vacuum-tube. How vacuum tubes worked was not understood at the time.  De Forest's initial Audions did not have a high vacuum and developed a blue glow at modest plate voltages; De Forest improved the vacuum for Federal Telegraph. By 1912, vacuum tube operation was understood, and regenerative circuits using high vacuum tubes were appreciated.", "While growing up, Armstrong had experimented with the early temperamental, \"gassy\" Audions. Spurred by the later discoveries, he developed a keen interest in gaining a detailed scientific understanding of how vacuum tubes worked. In conjunction with Professor Morecroft he used an oscillograph to conduct comprehensive studies. His breakthrough discovery was determining that employing positive feedback (also known as \"regeneration\") produced amplification hundreds of times greater than previously attained, with the amplified signals now strong enough so that receivers could use loudspeakers instead of headphones. Further investigation revealed that when the feedback was increased beyond a certain level a vacuum-tube would go into oscillation, thus could also be used as a continuous-wave radio transmitter.", "Beginning in 1913 Armstrong prepared a series of comprehensive demonstrations and papers that carefully documented his research, and in late 1913 applied for patent protection covering the regenerative circuit. On October 6, 1914,  was issued for his discovery. Although Lee de Forest initially discounted Armstrong's findings, beginning in 1915 de Forest filed a series of competing patent applications that largely copied Armstrong's claims, now stating that he had discovered regeneration first, based on August 6, 1912 notebook entry, while working for the Federal Telegraph company, prior to the January 31, 1913 date recognized for Armstrong. The result was an interference hearing at the patent office to determine priority. De Forest was not the only other inventor involved \u2013 the four competing claimants included Armstrong, de Forest, General Electric's Langmuir, and Alexander Meissner, who was a German national, which led to his application being seized by the Office of Alien Property Custodian during World War I.", "Following the end of WWI Armstrong enlisted representation by the law firm of Pennie, Davis, Martin and Edmonds. To finance his legal expenses he began issuing non-transferable licenses for use of the regenerative patents to a select group of small radio equipment firms, and by November 1920 17 companies had been licensed. These licensees paid 5% royalties on their sales which were restricted to only \"amateurs and experimenters\". Meanwhile, Armstrong reviewed his options for selling the commercial rights to his work. Although the obvious candidate was the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), on October 5, 1920 the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company took out an option for $335,000 for the commercial rights for both the regenerative and superheterodyne patents, with an additional $200,000 to be paid if Armstrong prevailed in the regenerative patent dispute. Westinghouse exercised this option on November 4, 1920.", "Legal proceedings related to the regeneration patent became separated into two groups of court cases. An initial court action was triggered in 1919 when Armstrong sued de Forest's company in district court, alleging infringement of patent 1,113,149. This court ruled in Armstrong's favor on May 17, 1921. A second line of court cases, the result of the patent office interference hearing, had a different outcome. The interference board had also sided with Armstrong, but he was unwilling to settle with de Forest for less than what he considered full compensation. Thus pressured, de Forest continued his legal defense, and appealed the interference board decision to the District of Columbia district court. On May 8, 1924, that court ruled that it was de Forest who should be considered regeneration's inventor. Armstrong (along with much of the engineering community) was shocked by these events, and his side appealed this decision. Although the legal proceeding twice went before the US Supreme Court, in 1928 and 1934, he was unsuccessful in overturning the decision.In response to the second Supreme Court decision upholding de Forest as the inventor of regeneration, Armstrong attempted to return his 1917 IRE Medal of Honor, which had been awarded \"in recognition of his work and publications dealing with the action of the oscillating and non-oscillating audion\". The organization's board refused to allow him, and issued a statement that it \"strongly affirms the original award\".Superheterodyne circuit", "The United States entered into WWI in April 1917. Later that year Armstrong was commissioned as a Captain in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, and assigned to a laboratory in Paris, France to help develop radio communication for the Allied war effort. He returned to the US in the autumn of 1919, after being promoted to the rank of Major. (During both world wars, Armstrong gave the US military free use of his patents.)During this period Armstrong's most significant accomplishment was the development of a \"supersonic heterodyne\" \u2013 soon shortened to \"superheterodyne\" \u2013 radio receiver circuit. This circuit made radio receivers more sensitive and selective and is extensively used today. The key feature of the superheterodyne approach is the mixing of the incoming radio signal with a locally generated, different frequency signal within a radio set. This circuit is called the mixer. The result is a fixed, unchanging intermediate frequency, or I.F. signal which is easily amplified and detected by following circuit stages. In 1919, Armstrong filed an application for a US patent of the superheterodyne circuit which was issued the next year. This patent was subsequently sold to Westinghouse. The patent was challenged, triggering another patent office interference hearing. Armstrong ultimately lost this patent battle; although the outcome was less controversial than that involving the regeneration proceedings.", "The challenger was Lucien L\u00e9vy of France who had worked developing Allied radio communication during WWI. He had been awarded French patents in 1917 and 1918 that covered some of the same basic ideas used in Armstrong's superheterodyne receiver. AT&T, interested in radio development at this time, primarily for point-to-point extensions of its wired telephone exchanges, purchased the US rights to L\u00e9vy's patent and contested Armstrong's grant. The subsequent court reviews continued until 1928, when the District of Columbia Court of Appeals disallowed all nine claims of Armstrong's patent, assigning priority for seven of the claims to L\u00e9vy, and one each to Ernst Alexanderson of General Electric and Burton W. Kendall of Bell Laboratories.", "Although most early radio receivers used regeneration Armstrong approached RCA's David Sarnoff, whom he had known since giving a demonstration of his regeneration receiver in 1913, about the corporation offering superheterodynes as a superior offering to the general public. (The ongoing patent dispute was not a hindrance, because extensive cross-licensing agreements signed in 1920 and 1921 between RCA, Westinghouse and AT&T meant that Armstrong could freely use the L\u00e9vy patent.) Superheterodyne sets were initially thought to be prohibitively complicated and expensive as the initial designs required multiple tuning knobs and used nine vacuum tubes. In conjunction with RCA engineers, Armstrong developed a simpler, less costly design. RCA introduced its superheterodyne Radiola sets in the US market in early 1924, and they were an immediate success, dramatically increasing the corporation's profits. These sets were considered so valuable that RCA would not license the superheterodyne to other US companies until 1930.Super-regeneration circuit", "The regeneration legal battle had one serendipitous outcome for Armstrong. While he was preparing apparatus to counteract a claim made by a patent attorney, he \"accidentally ran into the phenomenon of super-regeneration\", where, by rapidly \"quenching\" the vacuum-tube oscillations, he was able to achieve even greater levels of amplification. A year later, in 1922, Armstrong sold his super-regeneration patent to RCA for $200,000 plus 60,000 shares of corporation stock, which was later increased to 80,000 shares in payment for consulting services. This made Armstrong RCA's largest shareholder, and he noted that \"The sale of that invention was to net me more than the sale of the regenerative circuit and the superheterodyne combined\". RCA envisioned selling a line of super-regenerative receivers until superheterodyne sets could be perfected for general sales, but it turned out the circuit was not selective enough to make it practical for broadcast receivers.Wide-band FM radio\"Static\" interference \u2013 extraneous noises caused by sources such as thunderstorms and electrical equipment \u2013 bedeviled early radio communication using amplitude modulation  and perplexed numerous inventors attempting to eliminate it. Many ideas for static elimination were investigated, with little success. In the mid-1920s, Armstrong began researching a solution. He initially, and unsuccessfully, attempted to resolve the problem by modifying the characteristics of AM transmissions.", "One approach had been the use of frequency modulation (FM) transmissions. Instead of varying the strength of the carrier wave as with AM, the frequency of the carrier was changed to represent the desired audio signal. In 1922 John Renshaw Carson of AT&T, inventor of Single-sideband modulation (SSB), had published a detailed mathematical analysis which showed that FM transmissions did not provide any improvement over AM. Although the Carson bandwidth rule for FM is important today, this review turned out to be incomplete, because it analyzed only what is now known as \"narrow-band\" FM.In early 1928 Armstrong began researching the capabilities of FM. Although there were others involved in FM research at this time, he knew of an RCA project to see if FM shortwave transmissions were less susceptible to fading than AM. In 1931 the RCA engineers constructed a successful FM shortwave link transmitting the Schmeling\u2013Stribling fight broadcast from California to Hawaii, and noted at the time that the signals seemed to be less affected by static. The project made little further progress.", "Working in secret in the basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, Armstrong developed \"wide-band\" FM, in the process discovering significant advantages over the earlier \"narrow-band\" FM transmissions. In a \"wide-band\" FM system, the deviations of the carrier frequency are made to be much larger in magnitude than the frequency of the audio signal; this can be shown to provide better noise rejection. He was granted five US patents covering the basic features of new system on December 26, 1933. Initially, the primary claim was that his FM system was effective at filtering out the noise produced in receivers by vacuum tubes.Armstrong had a standing agreement to give RCA the right of first refusal to his patents. In 1934 he presented his new system to RCA president Sarnoff. Sarnoff was somewhat taken aback by its complexity, as he had hoped it would be possible to eliminate static merely by adding a simple device to existing receivers. From May 1934 until October 1935 Armstrong conducted field tests of his FM technology from an RCA laboratory located on the 85th floor of the Empire State Building in New York City. An antenna attached to the building's spire transmitted signals for distances up to . These tests helped demonstrate FM's static-reduction and high-fidelity capabilities. RCA, which was heavily invested in perfecting TV broadcasting, chose not to invest in FM, and instructed Armstrong to remove his equipment.", "Denied the marketing and financial clout of RCA, Armstrong decided to finance his own development and form ties with smaller members of the radio industry, including Zenith and General Electric, to promote his invention. Armstrong thought that FM had the potential to replace AM stations within 5 years, which he promoted as a boost for the radio manufacturing industry, then suffering from the effects of the Great Depression. Making existing AM radio transmitters and receivers obsolete would necessitate that stations buy replacement transmitters and listeners purchase FM-capable receivers. In 1936 he published a landmark paper in the Proceedings of the IRE that documented the superior capabilities of using wide-band FM. (This paper would be reprinted in the August 1984 issue of Proceedings of the IEEE.) A year later, a paper by Murray G. Crosby (inventor of Crosby system for FM Stereo) in the same journal provided further analysis of the wide-band FM characteristics, and introduced the concept of \"threshold\", demonstrating that there is a superior signal-to-noise ratio when the signal is stronger than a certain level.", "In June 1936, Armstrong gave a formal presentation of his new system at the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) headquarters. For comparison, he played a jazz record using a conventional AM radio, then switched to an FM transmission. A United Press correspondent was present, and recounted in a wire service report that: \"if the audience of 500 engineers had shut their eyes they would have believed the jazz band was in the same room. There were no extraneous sounds.\" Moreover, \"Several engineers said after the demonstration that they consider Dr. Armstrong's invention one of the most important radio developments since the first earphone crystal sets were introduced.\" Armstrong was quoted as saying he could \"visualize a time not far distant when the use of ultra-high frequency wave bands will play the leading role in all broadcasting\", although the article noted that \"A switchover to the ultra-high frequency system would mean the junking of present broadcasting equipment and present receivers in homes, eventually causing the expenditure of billions of dollars.\"", "In the late 1930s, as technical advances made it possible to transmit on higher frequencies, the FCC investigated options for increasing the number of broadcasting stations, in addition to ideas for better audio quality, known as \"high-fidelity\". In 1937 it introduced what became known as the Apex band, consisting of 75 broadcasting frequencies from 41.02 to 43.98\u00a0MHz. As on the standard broadcast band these were AM stations, but with higher quality audio \u2013 in one example, a frequency response from 20\u00a0Hz to 17,000\u00a0Hz +/-\u00a01\u00a0dB \u2013 because station separations were 40\u00a0kHz instead of the 10\u00a0kHz spacings used on the original AM band. Armstrong worked to convince the FCC that a band of FM broadcasting stations would be a superior approach. That year he financed the construction of the first FM radio station, W2XMN (later KE2XCC) at Alpine, New Jersey. FCC engineers had believed that transmissions using high frequencies would travel little farther than line-of-sight distances, limited by the horizon. When operating with 40 kilowatts on 42.8\u00a0MHz, the station could be clearly heard  away, matching the daytime coverage of a full power 50-kilowatt AM station.", "FCC studies comparing the Apex station transmissions with Armstrong's FM system concluded that his approach was superior. In early 1940, the FCC held hearings on whether to establish a commercial FM service. Following this review, the FCC announced the establishment of an FM band effective January 1, 1941, consisting of forty 200\u00a0kHz-wide channels on a band from 42\u201350\u00a0MHz, with the first five channels reserved for educational stations. Existing Apex stations were notified that they would not be allowed to operate after January 1, 1941 unless they converted to FM.", "Although there was interest in the new FM band by station owners, construction restrictions that went into place during WWII limited the growth of the new service. Following the end of WWII, the FCC moved to standardize its frequency allocations. One area of concern was the effects of tropospheric and Sporadic E propagation, which at times reflected station signals over great distances, causing mutual interference. A particularly controversial proposal, spearheaded by RCA, was that the FM band needed to be shifted to higher frequencies to avoid this problem. This reassignment was fiercely opposed as unneeded by Armstrong, but he lost. The FCC made its decision final on June 27, 1945. It allocated 100 FM channels from 88\u2013108\u00a0MHz, and assigned the former FM band to 'non government fixed and mobile' (42\u201344\u00a0MHz), and television channel 1 (44\u201350\u00a0MHz), now sidestepping the interference concerns. A period of allowing existing FM stations to broadcast on both low and high bands ended at midnight on January 8, 1949, at which time any low band transmitters were shut down, making obsolete 395,000 receivers that had already been purchased by the public for the original band. Although converters allowing low band FM sets to receive high band were manufactured, they ultimately proved to be complicated to install, and often as (or more) expensive than buying a new high band set outright.", "Armstrong felt the FM band reassignment had been inspired primarily by a desire to cause a disruption that would limit FM's ability to challenge the existing radio industry, including RCA's AM radio properties that included the NBC radio network, plus the other major networks including CBS, ABC and Mutual. The change was thought to have been favored by AT&T, as the elimination of FM relaying stations would require radio stations to lease wired links from that company. Particularly galling was the FCC assignment of TV channel 1 to the 44\u201350\u00a0MHz segment of the old FM band.  Channel 1 was later deleted, since periodic radio propagation would make local TV signals unviewable.Although the FM band shift was an economic setback, there was reason for optimism. A book published in 1946 by Charles A. Siepmann heralded FM stations as \"Radio's Second Chance\". In late 1945, Armstrong contracted with John Orr Young, founding member of the public relations firm Young & Rubicam, to conduct a national campaign promoting FM broadcasting, especially by educational institutions. Article placements promoting both Armstrong personally and FM were made with general circulation publications including The Nation, Fortune, The New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, and The Saturday Evening Post.", "In 1940, RCA offered Armstrong $1,000,000 for a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use his FM patents. He refused this offer, because he felt this would be unfair to the other licensed companies, which had to pay 2% royalties on their sales. Over time this impasse with RCA dominated Armstrong's life. RCA countered by conducting its own FM research, eventually developing what it claimed was a non-infringing FM system. The corporation encouraged other companies to stop paying royalties to Armstrong. Outraged by this, in 1948 Armstrong filed suit against RCA and the National Broadcasting Company, accusing them of patent infringement and that they had \"deliberately set out to oppose and impair the value\" of his invention, for which he requested treble damages. Although he was confident that this suit would be successful and result in a major monetary award, the protracted legal maneuvering that followed eventually began to impair his finances, especially after his primary patents expired in late 1950.FM radar", "During World War II, Armstrong turned his attention to investigations of continuous-wave FM radar funded by government contracts. Armstrong hoped that the interference fighting characteristic of wide-band FM and a narrow receiver bandwidth to reduce noise would increase range. Primary development took place at Armstrong\u2019s Alpine, NJ laboratory. A duplicate set of equipment was sent to the U.S. Army\u2019s Evans Signal Laboratory. The results of his investigations were inconclusive, the war ended, and the project was dropped by the Army.Under the name Project Diana, the Evans staff took up the possibility of bouncing radar signals off the moon. Calculations showed that standard pulsed radar like the stock SCR-271 would not do the job; higher average power, much wider transmitter pulses, and vary narrow receiver bandwidth would be required. They realized that the Armstrong equipment could be modified to accomplish the task. The FM modulator of the transmitter was disabled and the transmitter keyed to produce quarter-second CW pulses.  The narrow-band (57 Hz) receiver, which tracked the transmitter frequency, got an incremental tuning control to compensate for the possible 300 Hz Doppler shift on the lunar echoes. They achieved success on 10 January 1946.Death", "Bitter and overtaxed by years of litigation and mounting financial problems, Armstrong lashed out at his wife one day with a fireplace poker, striking her on the arm. She left their apartment to stay with her sister, Marjorie Tuttle, in Granby, Connecticut.Sometime during the night of January 31\u2013February 1, 1954, Armstrong jumped to his death from a window in his 12-room apartment on the 13th floor of River House in Manhattan, New York City. The New York Times described the contents of his two-page suicide note to his wife: \"he was heartbroken at being unable to see her once again, and expressing deep regret at having hurt her, the dearest thing in his life.\" The note concluded, \"God keep you and Lord have mercy on my Soul.\" David Sarnoff disclaimed any responsibility, telling Carl Dreher directly that \"I did not kill Armstrong.\" After his death, a friend of Armstrong estimated that 90 percent of his time was spent on litigation against RCA. U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-Wisconsin) reported that Armstrong had recently met with one of his investigators, and had been \"mortally afraid\" that secret radar discoveries by him and other scientists \"were being fed to the Communists as fast as they could be developed\". Armstrong was buried in Locust Grove Cemetery, Merrimac, Massachusetts.Legacy", "Following her husband's death, Marion Armstrong took charge of pursuing his estate's legal cases. In late December 1954, it was announced that through arbitration a settlement of \"approximately $1,000,000\" had been made with RCA. Dana Raymond of Cravath, Swaine & Moore in New York served as counsel in that litigation. Marion Armstrong was able to formally establish Armstrong as the inventor of FM following protracted court proceedings over five of his basic FM patents, with a series of successful suits, which lasted until 1967, against other companies that were found guilty of infringement.It was not until the 1960s that FM stations in the United States started to challenge the popularity of the AM band, helped by the development of FM stereo by General Electric, followed by the FCC's FM Non-Duplication Rule, which limited large-city broadcasters with AM and FM licenses to simulcasting on those two frequencies for only half of their broadcast hours. Armstrong's FM system was also used for communications between NASA and the Apollo program astronauts. (He is of no known relation to Apollo astronaut Neil Armstrong.)A US Postage Stamp was released in his honor in 1983 in a series commemorating American Inventors.", "Armstrong has been called \"the most prolific and influential inventor in radio history\". The superheterodyne process is still extensively used by radio equipment. Eighty years after its invention, FM technology has started to be supplemented, and in some cases replaced, by more efficient digital technologies. The introduction of digital television eliminated the FM audio channel that had been used by analog television, HD Radio has added digital sub-channels to FM band stations, and, in Europe and Pacific Asia, Digital Audio Broadcasting bands have been created that will, in some cases, eliminate existing FM stations altogether. However, FM broadcasting is still used internationally, and remains the dominant system employed for audio broadcasting services.Personal life", "In 1923, combining his love for high places with courtship rituals, Armstrong climbed the WJZ (now WABC) antenna located atop a 20-story building in New York City, where he reportedly did a handstand, and when a witness asked him what motivated him to \"do these damnfool things\", Armstrong replied \"I do it because the spirit moves me.\" Armstrong had arranged to have photographs taken, which he had delivered to David Sarnoff's secretary, Marion MacInnis. Armstrong and MacInnis married later that year. Armstrong bought a Hispano-Suiza motor car before the wedding, which he kept until his death, and which he drove to Palm Beach, Florida for their honeymoon. A publicity photograph was made of him presenting Marion with the world's first portable superheterodyne radio as a wedding gift.He was an avid tennis player until an injury in 1940, and drank an Old Fashioned with dinner. Politically, he was described by one of his associates as \"a revolutionist only in technology \u2013 in politics he was one of the most conservative of men.\"In 1955, Marion Armstrong founded the Armstrong Memorial Research Foundation, and participated in its work until her death in 1979 at the age of 81. She was survived by two nephews and a niece.", "Among Armstrong's living relatives are Steven McGrath, of Cape Elizabeth, Maine, formerly energy advisor to Maine's Governor, and Adam Brecht, a media executive in New York City, whose paternal great-grandfather, John Frank MacInnis, was the brother of Marion Armstrong. Edwin Howard Armstrong's niece, Jeanne Hammond, who represented the family in the Ken Burns documentary \"Empire of the Air\", died on May 1, 2019 in Scarborough, Maine. Ms. Hammond worked in her uncle's radio laboratory at Columbia University for several years following her graduation from Wellesley College in 1943.HonorsIn 1917, Armstrong was the first recipient of the IRE's (now IEEE) Medal of Honor.For his wartime work on radio, the French government gave him the Legion of Honor in 1919. He was awarded the 1941 Franklin Medal, and in 1942 received the AIEEs Edison Medal \"for distinguished contributions to the art of electric communication, notably the regenerative circuit, the superheterodyne, and frequency modulation.\" The ITU added him to its roster of great inventors of electricity in 1955.He later received two honorary doctorates, from Columbia in 1929, and Muhlenberg College in 1941.", "In 1980, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, and appeared on a U.S. postage stamp in 1983. The Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame inducted him in 2000, \"in recognition of his contributions and pioneering spirit that have laid the foundation for consumer electronics.\" Columbia University established the Edwin Howard Armstrong Professorship in the School of Engineering and Applied Science in his memory.Philosophy Hall, the Columbia building where Armstrong developed FM, was declared a National Historic Landmark. Armstrong's boyhood home in Yonkers, New York was recognized by the National Historic Landmark program and the National Register of Historic Places, although this was withdrawn when the house was demolished.Armstrong Hall at Columbia was named in his honor. The hall, located at the northeast corner of Broadway and 112th Street, was originally an apartment house but was converted to research space after being purchased by the university. It is currently home to the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, a research institute dedicated to atmospheric and climate science that is jointly operated by Columbia and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. A storefront in a corner of the building houses Tom's Restaurant, a longtime neighborhood fixture that inspired Susanne Vega's song \"Tom's Diner\" and was used for establishing shots for the fictional \"Monk's diner\" in the \"Seinfeld\" television series.", "A second Armstrong Hall, also named for the inventor, is located at the United States Army Communications and Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (CECOM-LCMC) Headquarters at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.PatentsE.

It began in December 2008 with a smoothed minimum sunspot number of 2.2, and ended in December 2019. Activity was minimal until early 2010. It reached its maximum in April 2014 with a 23 months smoothed sunspot number of 81.8. This maximum value was substantially lower than other recent solar cycles, down to a level which had not been seen since cycles 12 to 15 (1878-1923).PredictionsPrior to the minimum between the end of Solar Cycle 23 and the beginning of Solar Cycle 24, two theories predicted how strong Solar Cycle 24 would be. One camp postulated that the Sun retained a long memory (Solar Cycle 24 would be active) while the other asserted that it had a short memory (quiet). Prior to 2006, the difference was substantial with a minority of researchers predicting \"the smallest solar cycle in 100 years.\" Another group of researchers, including one at NASA, predicted that it \"looks like its going to be one of the most intense cycles since record-keeping began almost 400 years ago.\"The delayed onset of high latitude spots indicating the start of Solar Cycle 24 led the \"active cycle\" researchers to revise their predictions downward and the consensus by 2007 was split 5-4 in favor of a smaller cycle. By 2012, consensus was a small cycle, as solar cycles are much more predictable 3 years after minima.", "In May 2009 the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center's Solar Cycle 24 Prediction Panel predicted the cycle to peak at 90 sunspots in May 2013. In May 2012 NASA's expert David Hathaway predicted a peak in Spring of 2013 with about 60 sunspots.NASA funded and used Ken Schatten's physics-based models, which utilized a solar Dynamo model, to accurately predict the low. This method used the correlation between solar magnetic field strength at solar minimum to sunspot number at solar maximum to accurately predict the peak solar flux of each of the last three solar cycles. Schatten's predictions become accurate as early as solar minima, 5\u20136 years before solar max.Results In early 2013, after several months of calm, it was obvious that the active 2011 was not a prelude to a widely predicted late 2012-early 2013 peak in solar flares, sunspots and other activity. This unexpected stage prompted some scientists to propose a \"double-peaked\" solar maximum, which then occurred. The first peak reached 99 in 2011 and the second peak came in early 2014 at 101.SpeculationAccording to NASA, the intensity of geomagnetic storms during Solar Cycle 24 may be elevated in some areas where the Earth's magnetic field is weaker than expected. This fact was discovered by the THEMIS spacecraft in 2008. A 20-fold increase in particle counts that penetrate the Earth's magnetic field may be expected. Solar Cycle 24 has been the subject of various hypotheses and commentary pertaining to its potential effects on Earth.", "While acknowledging that the next solar maximum will not necessarily produce unusual geomagnetic activity, astrophysicist Michio Kaku took advantage of the media focus on the 2012 phenomenon to draw attention to the need to develop strategies for coping with the terrestrial damage that such an event could inflict. He asserted that governments should ensure the integrity of electrical infrastructure, so as to prevent a recurrence of disruption akin to that caused by the solar storm of 1859.The current solar cycle is currently the subject of research, as it is not generating sunspots in the expected manner. Sunspots did not begin to appear immediately after the last minimum (in 2008) and although they started to reappear in late 2009, they were at significantly lower rates than anticipated.On April 19, 2012, the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan predicted that the Sun's magnetic field would assume a quadrupole configuration.Throughout 2012, NASA posted news releases discrediting the 2012 phenomenon and the so-called Mayan prophecy, delinking them from solar activity and space weather.Events2008", "On 4 January 2008, an active region appeared with magnetic polarity reversed compared to that expected by Hale's law for solar cycle 23. This presaged the start of solar cycle 24\u2014though did not mark its official beginning. The region was located at the relatively high latitude 30\u00b0 N which, according to Sp\u00f6rer's law, provided further evidence for the arrival of cycle 24. The NOAA assigned it the active region number AR10981.Only a few sunspots were observed on the surface of the Sun throughout 2008. The smoothed monthly sunspot number reached a minimum of 2.2 in December 2008, therefore an international panel of scientists declared that month as solar minimum and the beginning of Solar Cycle 24.2009Solar activity remained extremely low throughout 2009. The observed monthly sunspots exceeded 10 only in December.2010On 19 January 2010, active region AR11041 produced an M2.3-class flare, the first flare of cycle 24 above M-class. It was followed by an M1.7-class flare seven hours later and four consecutive M-class flares the next day. Among the four flares, the strongest reached a strength of M3.4.On 12 February 2010, active region AR11046 produced an M8.3-class flare. Later in the month, active regions AR11045 and AR11046 unleashed a total of nine M-class flares.", "On 5 April 2010, the first coronal mass ejection (CME) of cycle 24 erupted at an active region causing a G3 (strong) geomagnetic storm on Earth. The Kp index, which quantifies disturbances in the horizontal component of Earth's magnetic field, reached a value of 7.On 1 and 2 August 2010, a series of four large CMEs were observed erupting from the Sun's Earth-facing side. These CMEs were likely connected to a C3.2-class flare from active region AR11092 despite the CMEs taking place about 400,000\u00a0km apart from the region. On 4 August 2010, a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm caused aurorae to be visible in the northern hemisphere at latitudes as far south as 45\u00b0 N near Michigan and Wisconsin in the United States, and Ontario, Canada. European observers reported sightings as far south as Denmark near latitude 56\u00b0 N. The aurorae were reportedly green in color due to the interaction of the solar particles with oxygen atoms in the relatively denser atmosphere of southern latitudes.On 14 August 2010, a C4.4-class flare produced the first solar radiation storm of cycle 24. The proton storm event was minor, rating at S1, and was easily absorbed by the Earth's ionosphere.On 6 November 2010, active region AR11121 emitted an M5.4 flare.2011February", "'Valentine\u2019s Day' 2011 flarePeaking at 01:56 UT on February 15, 2011, sunspot group 1158 produced an X2.2-class solar flare. Dubbed the Valentine's Day solar event by the scientific community, it was the first Solar Cycle 24 flare reaching X class level. In fact, it was the first of its class since December 2006. NOAA issued an R3 (strong) radio blackout alert pertaining this prominent x-ray flux event. In addition to flashing Earth with X and UV radiation, the explosion also hurled a CME in Earth's direction. The magnetosphere was impacted on February 18. The CME struck a minor G1-level geomagnetic storm.Shortly before, on February 13, sunspot 1158 had unleashed an M6.6-class solar flare. On February 18, the same active region produced another x-ray burst with the same strength. 13 M-class bursts were registered in February 2011.March A CME exploded from the vicinity of sunspot 1164 during the late hours of March 7, 2011. It leapt away from the Sun traveling ~2200\u00a0km/s, making it the fastest CME since September 2005.On March 9, active region 1166 erupted in an X1.5 flare. An R3-level radio blackout was reported. The related CME caused a G2 geomagnetic storm two days later. 21 M-class flares were registered this month.July Sunspot 1260 produced an M9.3-class solar flare on July 30, 2011. Because of its brevity, the eruption did not hurl a substantial cloud of ionized material or CME toward Earth, so it was not geoeffective.", "August On August 5, 2011, the combined cloud of three consecutive CMEs produced brilliant aurorae, reported as far south as Oklahoma and Alabama. The geomagnetic storm reached a G4 (severe) level, enough to create power outages. It was one of the strongest geomagnetic storms in years. In the southern hemisphere, aurorae could be seen as far north as South Africa, Southern Chile and Southern Australia. The CMEs were hurled by three M-class flares erupting in active sunspot 1261: M1.4 on August 2, M6.0 on August 3 and M9.3 on August 4.X6.9-class flareOn August 9 at 08:05 UT, sunspot 1263 produced a massive X6.9-class solar flare, the third X-flare of Solar Cycle 24 and the most powerful so far (as of May 2013). There was also a CME associated with this burst. Although the flare was not Earth-directed, radiation created waves of ionization in Earth's upper atmosphere, briefly disrupting communications at some VLF and HF radio frequencies. An R3-level (strong) radio blackout alert was issued. A proton event greater than 10 MeV (million electron volts) and exceeding 10 pfu (proton flux units) was also reported, so an S1-level solar radiation storm was also issued.", "September Sunspot 1283 erupted with an M5.3-class solar flare on September 6 at 01:50 UT. An R2 (moderate) blackout radio alert was issued. The burst was Earth-directed. Just 21 hours later, an X2.1-class flare \u2013 some four times stronger than the earlier flare \u2013 erupted from the same sunspot region. NOAA detected an R3 (strong) radio blackout and an S1 (minor) solar radiation storm. The combined CMEs of these bursts arrived at Earth on September 9, provoking a G3 (strong) geomagnetic storm.The next day, September 7, an X1.8-class solar flare erupted from sunspot 1283, producing an S1 solar radiation storm. A fourth flare, an M6-class, was ejected by the same sunspot on September 8.This sequence of flares produced waves of ionization in Earth's upper atmosphere, briefly altering the propagation of low-frequency radio signals around Earth. Moreover, the eruptions hurled clouds of plasma in its direction. CME impacts, strong geomagnetic storms and aurorae were registered from September 9 onwards.", "Then, on September 22, an X1.4-class solar flare erupted out of sunspot 1302. An R3-level radio blackout was registered. The blast produced a significant CME, but was not Earth directed. Two days later, an X1.9-class flare, followed in the next 31 hours by a spectacular string of 14 M-class flares, the biggest being two M7 flares, was mostly unleashed out of the same sunspot. The first two explosions, X1.9 and M7.1, propelled a pair of closely spaced CMEs. A G4 (severe) geomagnetic storm was reported on September 26.In total, the Sun produced four X flares and 31 M flares in September 2011, one of the most active months of Solar Cycle 24 so far.October The Sun unleashed eight M-class flares this month, being the strongest the M3.9 event, followed by an Earth-directed CME, produced by sunspot 1305 on October 2. Just in the eve, sunspots 1302 and 1305 had emitted flares almost at the same time; the first event was a C-class and the second one reached a M1.2 category. This double eruption, which hurled a double CME as well, were particularly interesting as coincided with the arrival of a comet, discovered by amateur astronomers the previous day, that disintegrated in spectacular fashion when it plunged into the Sun. A very similar scenario happened on May 10\u201311, 2011.", "NovemberOn November 3, 2011, active region 1339, one of the largest sunspots in years - 40,000\u00a0km wide and at least twice that in length - unleashed an X1.9-class solar flare. Waves of ionization in the upper atmosphere created an R3 (strong) radio blackout. The related CME was not headed for Earth. 13 M-class flares were registered this month. November 2011 may be considered the most active month of the current Cycle 24 so far, as monthly sunspot count was nearly 100 (96.7) and the same went for the F10.7 Solar Flux (the radio emission from the Sun at a wavelength of 10.7\u00a0cm) that racked up a value of 153.1. However, these numbers are well below those of Cycle 23 at its peak. Cycle 23 peak sunspot count was 170 and its F10.7 was about 235.December Solar activity increased again in late December, with the Sun unleashing eight M-flares. The most intense flare, produced by sunspot 1385, was an M4.0 event on December 25. The year 2011 ended up with 111 M-class and 8 X-class solar flares.2012", "January Active sunspot 1401 erupted an M3.2-class solar flare and a full-halo CME on January 19, 2012. The CME hit the Earth's magnetic field in the early hours of January 22, with minor geomagnetic disturbances reported.Sunspot 1402 erupted a long-duration M8.7-class flare, followed by a CME, on January 23, 2012 at 03:59 UTC. According to NOAA, the flare's radiation storm was ranked as S3 (strong), the strongest since May 2005. The very fast-moving CME arrived at the Earth on January 24 at approximately 15:00 UTC. The geomagnetic storm reached a G1 level (minor), the same level recorded by the previous M3-class flare.On January 27, at 18:37 UT, sunspot region 1402 unleashed an X1.7-class flare, prompting NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center to issue an R3 (strong) Radio Blackout warning and an S2 (moderate) Solar Radiation Storm warning. Sunspot 1402 was rotating onto the far side of the Sun, so the blast site was not facing Earth. The explosion also produced a huge CME, but not Earth-oriented, so no geomagnetic storm was expected.March", "Following several minor C-class flares, M-class flares and CMEs registered in previous days and weeks, active region 1429 erupted an X1.1-class flare on March 5 at 04:13 GMT. The wave of high energy electromagnetic rays, reaching Earth in minutes, caused an R3 (strong) radio blackout over China, India and Australia, according to NOAA. Sunspot region 1429, whose size was half of that of Jupiter and was rotating toward Earth, was being particularly active since it materialized on March 2. The CME that followed arrived at the Earth on March 7 and caused a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm. Just hours after ejecting the X1.1-class flare, it produced several minor C and M-class flares in quick succession.X5.4-class flareAfter releasing up to nine M-class flares in only one day, the active region 1429 erupted a powerful X5.4-class flare at 00:24 UTC on March 7. The related CME impacted the Earth on March 8, causing a G3 (strong) geomagnetic storm. This event marked the second strongest solar flare of Cycle 24 in terms of X-ray flux. NOAA launched R3 (strong) radio blackout and S3 (strong) solar radiation storm alerts. Just one hour after that first flare, nearby sunspot 1430 released a less powerful X1.3-class flare. No CME associated to this event was reported. Months later, in June, NASA reported that its Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected in this powerful flare the highest flux of gamma rays \u2014 greater than 100 MeV \u2014 ever associated with an eruption on the Sun.", "AR1429, rotating toward the other side of the Sun, generated an M6.3-class flare on March 9, an M8.5 flare one day later and an M7.9 flare on March 13. These eruptions hurled CMEs, all Earth-oriented. The first wave of plasma impacted the magnetosphere on March 12, causing a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm. The second CME was not geoeffective. The third wave of ionized gas reached Earth on March 15, causing another G2 storm.In late March, the US Air Force Space Command reported that the solar storms of March 7\u201310 could have temporarily knocked American military satellites offline. NASA also reported that these powerful flares heated the Earth's upper atmosphere with the biggest dose of infrared radiation since 2005. From March 8 to March 10, the thermosphere absorbed 26 billion kWh of energy. Infrared radiation from carbon dioxide and nitric oxide, the two most efficient coolants in the thermosphere, re-radiated 95% of that total back into space.March 2012, one of the most active months of Solar Cycle 24, ended up with 19 M-class and three X-class flares.April A prominent eruption produced a CME off the east limb (left side) of the Sun on April 16, 2012. Such eruptions are often associated with solar flares, and in this case an M1.7-class (medium-sized) flare occurred at the same time, peaking at 1:45 PM EDT (17.45 UTC). The CME was not aimed toward Earth. Nevertheless, this month was very quiet in comparison to the previous one, as only two M-class flares were recorded.", "May Solar activity increased again this month, with 12 M-class flares ejected, the strongest being an M5.7 flare produced by active region 1476 on May 10. This so-called \"monster\" sunspot complex, the largest active region of the cycle to date, was about the size of Jupiter, or eleven times the diameter of Earth.June11 M-class solar flares were observed this month, the largest being an M3.3 flare.JulyAn X1.1-class flare erupted from sunspot 1515 on July 6, generating an R3 (strong) radio blackout and an S1 (minor) solar storm; its related CME caused a G1 (minor) geomagnetic storm. Six days after, sunspot 1520, the largest active region of Solar Cycle 24 to date, unleashed an X1.4-class flare, peaking at 12:52 PM EDT. This huge group of sunspots, which rotated into view on July 6, was located in the center of the Sun at the time of this event. The related CME caused a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm, following an R3 radio blackout and an S1 solar storm.", "The Sun emitted a moderate solar flare on July 19, 2012, beginning at 1:13 AM EDT and peaking at 1:58 AM. The flare was classified as an M7.7 flare. It was also emitted from sunspot 1520. Other M-class flares registered this month included an M6.9 (July 8, sunspot 1515), an M6.1 (July 5, sunspot 1515), an M6.1 (July 28, sunspot 1532), an M5.6 (July 2, sunspot 1515) and an M5.3 (July 4, sunspot 1515). The month ended up with 45 M-class flares and 2 X-class flares, which is the highest number of such flares within the current solar cycle to date. Nevertheless, July 2012 was not the most active month in solar radio flux and number of sunspots.Solar storm of 2012August On August 31, 2012, a long filament of solar material that had been hovering in the Sun's atmosphere (the corona) erupted out into space at 4:36\u00a0p.m. EDT. The CME traveled at over 1500\u00a0km (900 miles) per second. The CME did not travel directly toward Earth, but did connect with Earth's magnetic environment, or magnetosphere, with a glancing blow. causing aurorae to appear on the night of Monday, September 3. A G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm was registered on September 3 and September 5.The Sun erupted 10 M-class flares this month, the largest being an M5.5 burst ejected on August 18.", "SeptemberA filament eruption occurred during the late hours of September 27, resulting in a brief S1 (minor) radiation storm, alerted by NOAA in the early hours of the next day. The Earth-directed CME associated with this event affected Earth on September 30. A G3 geomagnetic storm was registered on October 1. The filament eruption was connected to a C3.7 flare which occurred in the vicinity of sunspot 1577.Solar activity decreased remarkably this month. 4 minor solar flares, below M2, were registered in September 2012.October On October 8 and 9, the arrival of a CME unrelated to solar flares and emitted on October 5 caused disturbances in the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field. The planetary Kp-index reached level 6, so a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm was reported. The Sun released an M9.0 flare on October 20. This was followed three days later on October 23 by a very impulsive flare, peaking as an X1.8-class event at 3:17\u00a0a.m. UTC. Both flares came from active region 1598, located on the left side (east) of the sun, which had previously been the source of a number of weaker flares. The M9.0 burst occurred when the sunspot was not yet rotated onto the Earth-facing side of the solar disk. The NOAA categorized the radio blackout associated with the X1.8 event as an R3. This was the 7th and last X-class flare in 2012. There was no associated Earth-directed CME.", "November 14 M-class flares were registered this month, the strongest being an M6.0 flare, which erupted on November 13 by AR1613.December Solar activity decreased significantly this month. For first time in two years (since December 2010), no X or M-class flares were emitted by the Sun's Earth-facing side (the strongest flare was merely a C4.1). The observed sunspots were 40.8 and the 10.7\u00a0cm radio flux value was 108.4, the lowest in ten months.2012 ended up with 129 M-class and 7 X-class solar flares.2013April The unexpectedly low solar activity continued in April 2013. Only 13 M-class flares were reported from December 2012 to April 2013, the strongest being an M6.5 unleashed by active region 1719 on the 11th. This event generated an R2 radio blackout and an R2 radiation storm. The observed sunspots this month were 72.4 and the 10.7\u00a0cm radio flux value was 125.0.May", "String of X-class flaresSolar activity increased rapidly in mid-May 2013 with four consecutive strong flares in two days. These powerful bursts all surged from the just-numbered sunspot AR1748, located on the eastern limb of the Sun and barely rotating around the front of the solar disk. AR1748 emitted the first flare, an X1.7-class, on May 13, peaking at 02:17 UTC. This event was quickly followed the same day at 16:09 UTC by an X2.8-class flare. On May 14 at 01:17 UTC the same sunspot emitted an X3.2-class flare, the third strongest of the current solar cycle so far. This was followed by an X1.2-class flare at 01:52 UTC on May 15. The four X-ray bursts generated an R3 (strong) radio blackout in the upper atmosphere.Every X-ray event was followed by a CME. The first three CMEs were not geoeffective at all as they were not directed toward Earth; the fourth CME was partially geoeffective, so a G1 (minor) geomagnetic storm was expected to occur on May 18. An S1 (minor) proton storm event was also detected in connection with the May 15 X1.2 flare.2014February On February 24, 2014, the sun erupted with an X4.9-class solar flare, the strongest of that year.", "October Four solar flares occurred within 5 days from sunspot AR 12192, which is both the largest sunspot of solar cycle 24 and the largest since 1990. On October 19 there was a major X1.1-class solar flare. On October 22 an M8.7-class flare was followed by an X1.6 event. The October 24 X3.1-class solar flare was strong enough to trigger a radio blackout. Larger than the planet Jupiter, the AR 12192 sunspot was visible during a partial solar eclipse seen in North America.2015June The sun emitted a mid-level solar flare, an M7.9-class, peaking at 4:16\u00a0a.m. EDT on June 25, 2015.November In early November 2015, solar flares disrupted the air traffic control system in central and southern Sweden, causing heavy delays for passengers.2016December A sunspot group originally attributed to the new solar cycle 25 is observed. The sunspot numbers continue to decline.During 2016, there were 26 days with no sunspots (preliminary numbers).2017March As of 31 March, preliminary reports indicate there had been 24 days during 2017 during which there were no sunspots.", "September On 6 September the largest X-class flare in a decade (X9.3) erupted from active region 2673.Then, when this region was just crossing the west limb, another X-class flare (SOL2017-09-10, X8.2) produced only the second ground-level particle event of the cycle. Sunspot region 2673 was one of the most active regions during the entire cycle, creating both of the largest flares in the cycle and 4 total X-class flares. No further M class flares would take place during the rest of Solar cycle 24.2018January A small active region, NOAA 12694, appeared at the surprisingly high latitude of S32, near the disk center (January 8). Its location conflicted directly with the expectation from the butterfly diagram. In principle new-cycle spots should appear at such a latitude, but this region had the correct polarity for Cycle 24.March NOAA reported that the number of sunspots was the lowest since 2009, and that recent activity matched that of the low activity in 2007 and 2008. Should this prove to be the solar minimum, Solar Cycle 24 would uniquely become a short (10 year) and weak cycle. Sunspots were observed on only 5 days that month.2019May A C6.8 flare took place on 9 May 2019, the strongest solar flare to take place since October 2017.July NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory recorded a sunspot from Solar Cycle 25. This sunspot is significant compared to previous sunspots from Solar Cycle 25 due to the fact that it lasted long enough to get a designation.", "October The sun reached its absolute solar minimum in October 2019, marking the end of Solar cycle 24 and the beginning of Solar cycle 25.See also List of solar cycles Solar variationReferencesExternal links Solar Cycle 24 Prediction at NASA Solar Cycle 24 Progression at NOAA Solar Cycle Prediction at NOAA24Articles containing video clips"]}}
