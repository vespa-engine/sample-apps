    "# Evaluating a Vespa Application\n",
    "\n",
    "We are often asked by users and customers what is the best retrieval and ranking strategy for a given use case. And even though we might sometimes have an intuition, we always recommend to set up experiments and do a proper quantitative evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Models are temporary; Evals are forever.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> -Eugene Yan\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a proper evaluation setup, you run the risk of settling for `lgtm@10` (looks good to me @ 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if you deploy your application to users, you can be sure that you will get feedback of queries that does not produce relevant results. If you then try to optimize for that without knowing whether your tweaks are actually improving the overall quality of your search, you might end up with a system that is worse than the one you started with. \n",

    "## So, what can you do? \n",
    "\n",
    "You can set up a proper evaluation pipeline, where you can test different ranking strategies, and see how they perform on a set of evaluation queries that act as a proxy for your real users' queries. This way, you can make informed decisions about what works best for your use case. If you collect real user interactions, it could be even better, but it is important to also keep the evaluation pipeline light enough so that you can run it both during development and in CI pipelines (possibly at different scales).\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will show how you easily can evaluate a Vespa application using pyvespa's `VespaMatchEvaluator` and `VespaEvaluator` class.\n",

    "### Evaluate match-phase (retrieval) for recall\n",
    "\n",
    "The match-phase (or retrieval phase) in Vespa is perform to retrieve candidate documents to rank. Here, what we care about is that all possibly relevant documents are retrieved fast, without matching too many documents. If we match too many documents, latency will suffer, as all retrieved docs will be exposed to ranking. For an introduction to phased retrieval in Vespa, see the [docs](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/phased-ranking.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will evaluate and compare `weakAnd`, `nearestNeighbor`, as well as the combination of the two (using `OR`-operator).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluate ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "We will define and compare 4 different ranking strategies in this guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `bm25` - Keyword-based retrieval and ranking - The solid baseline.\n",
    "2. `semantic` - Vector search using cosine similarity (using https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-small-v2 for embeddings)\n",
    "3. `fusion`- Hybrid search (semantic+keyword). Combining BM25 and Semantic with [reciprocal rank fusion](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/phased-ranking.html#cross-hit-normalization-including-reciprocal-rank-fusion)\n",
    "4. `atan_norm` - Hybrid search, combining BM25 and Semantic with [atan normalization](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/tutorials/hybrid-search.html#hybrid-ranking) as described in Aapo Tanskanen's [Guidebook to the State-of-the-Art Embeddings and Information Retrieval](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/guidebook-state-of-the-art-embeddings-information-aapo-tanskanen-pc3mf/) (Originally proposed by [Seo et al.
