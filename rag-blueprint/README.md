# The RAG Blueprint

Vespa is the [platform of choice](https://blog.vespa.ai/perplexity-builds-ai-search-at-scale-on-vespa-ai/) for large scale RAG applications like Perplexity.
It gives you all the features you need but putting them all together can be a challenge.

This open source sample applications contains all the elements you need to create a RAG application that

* delivers state-of-the-art quality, and
* scales to any amount of data, query load, and complexity.

This README provides the steps to create and run your own application based on the blueprint.
Refer to the [RAG Blueprint tutorial](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/learn/tutorials/rag-blueprint.html) for more in-depth explanations,
or try out the [Python notebook](https://vespa-engine.github.io/pyvespa/examples/rag-blueprint-vespa-cloud.html).

Go to the [RAG Blueprint](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/examples/rag-blueprint.html) page to deploy and test it yourself,
and find links to what to do next.
