Because the package will be used by searcher and indexer,
it is recommended to define &lt;component&gt; in all &lt;container&gt; sections of services.xml.

```xml
<container id="mycontainer" version="1.0">
    <component id="com.qihoo.language.JiebaLinguistics" bundle="vespa-chinese-linguistics" >
        <config name="com.qihoo.language.config.dicts-loc">
            <dictionaryPath>/opt/vespa/conf/jieba</dictionaryPath>
            <stopwordsPath>/opt/vespa/conf/jieba/stopwords</stopwordsPath>
        </config>
    </component>
</container>
```
