### Deploy
Put the built package to components directory of your service.
If there is no _components_ directory, create it.
For example, the structure will be like below with sampleapps.

* sampleapps/search/kosmos/
    * services.xml
    * components/
        * chinese-linguistics-1.0.0-deploy.jar


### Configuration

Because the package will be used by searcher and indexer,
it is recommended to define &lt;component&gt; in all &lt;container&gt; sections of services.xml.

```xml
<container id="mycontainer" version="1.0">
    <component id="com.qihoo.language.JiebaLinguistics" bundle="chinese-linguistics" >
        <config name="com.qihoo.language.config.dicts-loc">
            <dictionaryPath>/opt/vespa/conf/dict</dictionaryPath>
            <stopwordsPath>/opt/vespa/conf/stopwords</stopwordsPath>
        </config>
    </component>
</container>
```
