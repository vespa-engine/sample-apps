OBJECTIVE: To examine children's total <hi>and</hi> component diet quality <hi>and</hi> <hi>asthma</hi> <hi>and</hi> airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), a proxy for <hi>asthma</hi> severity. METHODS: Food frequency questionnaires adapted from the Nurses' Health Study <hi>and</hi> supplemented with foods whose nutrients which have garnered interest of late in relation to <hi>asthma</hi> were administered. From these data, diet quality scores (total <hi>and</hi> component), based on the Youth Healthy Eating Index (YHEI adapted) were developed. <hi>Asthma</hi> assessments were performed by pediatric allergists <hi>and</hi> classified by atopic status: Allergic <hi>asthma</hi> (≥1 positive skin prick test to common allergens >3 mm compared to negative control) versus non-allergic <hi>asthma</hi> (negative skin prick test). AHR was assessed via the Cockcroft technique. Participants included 270 boys (30% with <hi>asthma</hi>) <hi>and</hi> 206 girls (33% with <hi>asthma</hi>) involved in the 1995 Manitoba Prospective Cohort Study nested case-control study. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between diet quality <hi>and</hi> <hi>asthma</hi>, <hi>and</hi> multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associations between diet quality <hi>and</hi> AHR. RESULTS: Four hundred seventy six children (56.7% boys) were seen at 12.6 ± 0.5 years. <hi>Asthma</hi> <hi>and</hi> AHR prevalence were 26.2 <hi>and</hi> 53.8%, respectively. In fully adjusted models, high <hi>vegetable</hi> intake was protective against allergic <hi>asthma</hi> (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.29-0.84; P < 0.009) <hi>and</hi> moderate/severe AHR (OR 0.58; 0.37-0.91; P < 0.019).

       "     'body': \"Background Atopy is not uncommon among children living in rural Crete, but wheeze <hi>and</hi> rhinitis are rare. A study was undertaken to examine whether this discrepancy could be attributed to a high consumption of fresh fruit <hi>and</hi> <hi>vegetables</hi> or adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet. Methods A cross‐sectional survey was performed in 690 children aged 7–18\\u2005years in rural Crete. Parents completed a questionnaire on their child's respiratory <hi>and</hi> allergic symptoms <hi>and</hi> a 58‐item food frequency questionnaire. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet was measured using a scale with 12 dietary items. Children underwent skin prick tests with 10 common aeroallergens. Results 80% of children ate fresh fruit (<hi>and</hi> 68% <hi>vegetables</hi>) at least twice a day. The intake of grapes, oranges, apples, <hi>and</hi> fresh tomatoes—the main local products in Crete—had no association with atopy but was protective for wheezing <hi>and</hi> rhinitis. A high consumption of nuts was found to be inversely associated with wheezing (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.98), whereas margarine increased the risk of both wheeze (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.01 to 4.82) <hi>and</hi> allergic rhinitis (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.31 to 3.37). A high level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was protective for allergic rhinitis (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.64) while a more modest protection was observed for wheezing <hi>and</hi> atopy. Conclusion The results of this study suggest a beneficial effect of commonly consumed <hi>fruits</hi>, <hi>vegetables</hi> <hi>and</hi> nuts, <hi>and</hi> of a high adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet during childhood on symptoms of <hi>asthma</hi> <hi>and</hi> rhinitis. Diet may explain the relative lack of allergic symptoms in this population.\",\n",

We previously showed that short-term manipulation of antioxidant defenses leads to changes in <hi>asthma</hi> outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the effects of a high-antioxidant diet compared with those of a low-antioxidant diet, with or without lycopene supplementation, in <hi>asthma</hi>. DESIGN: <hi>Asthmatic</hi> adults (n = 137) were randomly assigned to a high-antioxidant diet (5 servings of <hi>vegetables</hi> <hi>and</hi> 2 servings of fruit daily; n = 46) or a low-antioxidant diet (≤2 servings of <hi>vegetables</hi> <hi>and</hi> 1 serving of fruit daily; n = 91) for 14 d <hi>and</hi> then commenced a parallel, randomized, controlled supplementation trial. Subjects who consumed the high-antioxidant diet received placebo. Subjects who consumed the low-antioxidant diet received placebo or tomato extract (45 mg lycopene/d). The intervention continued until week 14 or until an exacerbation occurred. RESULTS: After 14 d, subjects consuming the low-antioxidant diet had a lower percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s <hi>and</hi> percentage predicted forced vital capacity than did those consuming the high-antioxidant diet. Subjects in the low-antioxidant diet group had increased plasma C-reactive protein at week 14. At the end of the trial, time to exacerbation was greater in the high-antioxidant than in the low-antioxidant diet group, <hi>and</hi> the low-antioxidant diet group was 2.26 (95% CI: 1.04, 4.91; P = 0.039) times as likely to exacerbate. Of the subjects in the low-antioxidant diet group, no difference in airway or systemic inflammation or clinical outcomes was observed between the groups that consumed the tomato extract <hi>and</hi> those who consumed placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Modifying the dietary intake of carotenoids alters clinical <hi>asthma</hi> outcomes. Improvements were evident only after increased fruit <hi>and</hi> <hi>vegetable</hi> intake, which suggests that whole-food interventions are most effective.

       "     'body': 'This study aimed to evaluate the association of diet with respiratory symptoms <hi>and</hi> <hi>asthma</hi> in schoolchildren in Taipei, Taiwan. An in-class interview survey elicited experiences of <hi>asthma</hi> <hi>and</hi> respiratory symptoms <hi>and</hi> consumption frequencies of the major food categories in 2290 fifth graders. Respiratory symptoms surveyed included persistent cough, chest tightness, wheezing with cold, wheezing without cold, dyspnea-associated wheezing, <hi>and</hi> exercise-induced cough or wheezing. Results showed that the consumption of sweetened beverages had the strongest association with respiratory symptoms <hi>and</hi> was positively associated with six of the seven respiratory symptoms (all p < 0.05). The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) ranged from 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI = 1.01-1.09) for exercise-induced cough to 1.09 (95% CI = 1.03-1.16) for wheezing without cold. Egg consumption was associated with 5 of the 7 respiratory symptoms. Consumptions of seafood, soy products, <hi>and</hi> <hi>fruits</hi> were each negatively associated with one of the seven respiratory symptoms (all p < 0.05). Consumption of seafood was negatively associated with physician-diagnosed <hi>asthma</hi> <hi>and</hi> consumptions of sweetened beverages <hi>and</hi> eggs were positively associated with suspected <hi>asthma</hi> (p < 0.05).
