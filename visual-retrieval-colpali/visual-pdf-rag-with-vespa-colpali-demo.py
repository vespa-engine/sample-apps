# # Visual PDF RAG with Vespa - ColPali demo application
#
# We created an end-to-end demo application for visual retrieval of PDF pages using Vespa, including a frontend web application. To see the live demo, visit https://vespa-engine-colpali-vespa-visual-retrieval.hf.space/.
#
# TODO: Add screenshot of the frontend
# The main goal of the demo is to make it easy for _you_ to create your own PDF Enterprise Search application using Vespa.
# To deploy a full demo, you need two main components:
# 1. A Vespa application that lets you index and search PDF pages using ColPali embeddings.
# 2. A web application that lets you interact with the Vespa application.
#
# After running this notebook, you will have set up a Vespa application, and indexed some PDF pages.
# You can then test that you are able to query the Vespa application, and you will be ready to deploy the web application including the frontend.
#
# Some of the features we want to highlight in this demo are:
# - Visual retrieval of PDF pages using ColPali embeddings
# - Explainability by displaying similarity maps over the patches in the PDF pages for each querytoken.
# - Extracting queries and questions from the PDF pages using `gemini-1.5-8b` model.
# - Typeahead search suggestions based on the extracted queries and questions.
# - Comparison of different retrieval and ranking strategies (BM25, ColPali MaxSim, and a combination of both).
# - AI-generated responses to the query based on the top ranked PDF pages. Also using the `gemini-1.5-8b` model.
#
# We also wanted to give a notion of which latency one can expect using Vespa for this use case.
# Event though your users might not state this explicitly, we consider it important to provide a snappy user experience.
#
# In this notebook, we will prepare the Vespa backend application for our visual retrieval demo.
# We will use ColPali as the model to extract patch vectors from images of pdf pages.
# At query time, we use MaxSim to retrieve and/or (based on the configuration) rank the page results.
#
#
#
# The steps we will take in this notebook are:
#
# 1. Setup and configuration
# 2. Download PDFs
# 3. Convert PDFs to images
# 4. Generate queries and questions
# 5. Generate ColPali embeddings
# 6. Prepare the Vespa application package
# 7. Deploy the Vespa application to Vespa Cloud
# 8. Feed the data to the Vespa application
# 9. Test a query to the Vespa application
#
# All the steps that are needed to provision the Vespa application, including feeding the data, can be done by running this notebook.
# We have tried to make it easy for others to run this notebook, to create your own PDF Enterprise Search application using Vespa.

# ## 4. Generate Queries
#
# In this step, we want to generate queries for each page image.
# These will be useful for 2 reasons:
#
# 1. We can use these queries as typeahead suggestions in the search bar.
# 2. We could potentially use the queries to generate an evaluation dataset. See [Improving Retrieval with LLM-as-a-judge](https://blog.vespa.ai/improving-retrieval-with-llm-as-a-judge/) for a deeper dive into this topic. This will not be within the scope of this notebook though.
#
# The prompt for generating queries is adapted from [this](https://danielvanstrien.xyz/posts/post-with-code/colpali/2024-09-23-generate_colpali_dataset.html#an-update-retrieval-focused-prompt) wonderful blog post by Daniel van Strien.
#
# We have modified the prompt to also generate keword based queries, in addition to the question based queries.
#
# We will use the Gemini API to generate these queries, with `gemini-1.5-flash-8b` as the model.

The report may be annual or quarterly reports, or policy reports, on topics such as responsible investment, risk etc.
Your task is to generate retrieval queries and questions that you would use to retrieve this document (or ask based on this document) in a large corpus.
Please generate 3 different types of retrieval queries and questions.
A retrieval query is a keyword based query, made up of 2-5 words, that you would type into a search engine to find this document.
A question is a natural language question that you would ask, for which the document contains the answer.
The queries should be of the following types:
1. A broad topical query: This should cover the main subject of the document.
2. A specific detail query: This should cover a specific detail or aspect of the document.
3. A visual element query: This should cover a visual element of the document, such as a chart, graph, or image.

Important guidelines:
- Ensure the queries are relevant for retrieval tasks, not just describing the page content.
- Use a fact-based natural language style for the questions.
- Frame the queries as if someone is searching for this document in a large corpus.
- Make the queries diverse and representative of different search strategies.

Format your response as a JSON object with the structure of the following example:
{
    "broad_topical_question": "What was the Responsible Investment Policy in 2019?",
    "broad_topical_query": "responsible investment policy 2019",
    "specific_detail_question": "What is the percentage of investments in renewable energy?",
    "specific_detail_query": "renewable energy investments percentage",
    "visual_element_question": "What is the trend of total holding value over time?",
    "visual_element_query": "total holding value trend"
}

If there are no relevant visual elements, provide an empty string for the visual element question and query.
Here is the document image to analyze:
Generate the queries based on this image and provide the response in the specified JSON format.
Only return JSON. Don't return any extra explanation text. """

# ### Configuring the application package
#
# [PyVespa](https://pyvespa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) helps us build the [Vespa application package](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/application-packages.html).
# A Vespa application package consists of configuration files, schemas, models, and code (plugins).
#
# Here are some of the key components of this application package:
#
# 1. We store images (and a scaled down version of the image) as a `raw` field.
# 2. We store the binarized ColPali embeddings as a `tensor<int8>` field.
# 3. We store the queries and questions as a `array<str>` field.
# 4. We define 3 different ranking profiles:
#     - `default` Uses BM25 for first phase ranking and MaxSim for second phase ranking.
#     - `bm25` Uses `bm25(title) + bm25(text)` (first phase only) for ranking.
#     - `retrieval-and-rerank` Uses `nearestneighbor` of the query embedding over the document embeddings for retrieval, `binary_max_sim` for first phase ranking, and `max_sim` of the query-embeddings as float for second phase ranking.
#     Vespa's [phased ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/phased-ranking.html) allows us to use different ranking strategies for retrieval and reranking, to choose attractive trade-offs between latency, cost, and accuracy.
#
# First, we define a [Vespa schema](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/schemas.html) with the fields we want to store and their type.

# ### Configuring the `services.xml`
#
# [services.xml](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/services.html) is the primary configuration file for a Vespa application, with a plethora of options to configure the application.
#
# Since `pyvespa` version `0.50.0`, these configuration options are also available in `pyvespa`. See [here](https://pyvespa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced-configuration.html) for more details. (Note that configurating this is optional).
#
# We will use the advanced configuration to configure up [dynamic snippets](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/document-summaries.html#dynamic-snippets). This allows us to highlight matched terms in the search results and generate a `snippet` to display, rather than the full text of the document.
